Here is a coast; here is a harbor;
here, after a meager diet of horizon, is some scenery;
impractically shaped and—who knows?—self-pitying mountains,
sad and harsh beneath their frivolous greenery,

with a little church on top of one. And warehouses,
some of them painted a feeble pink, or blue,
and some tall, uncertain palms. Oh, tourist,
is this how this country is going to answer you

and your immodest demands for a different world,
and a better life, and complete comprehension
of both at last, and immediately,
after eighteen days of suspension?

Finish your breakfast. The tender is coming,
a strange and ancient craft, flying a strange and brillant rag.
So that's the flag. I never saw it before.
I somehow never thought of there being a flag,

but of course there was, all along. And coins, I presume,
and paper money; they remain to be seen.
And gingerly now we climb down the ladder backward,
myself and a fellow passenger named Miss Breen,

descending into the midst of twenty-six freighters
waiting to be loaded with green coffee beans.
Please, boy, do be more careful with that boat hook!
Watch out! Oh! It has caught Miss Breen's

skirt! There! Miss Breen is about seventy,
a retired police lieutenant, six feet tall,
with beautiful bright blue eyes and a kind expression.
Her home, when she is at home, is in Glens Fall

s, New York. There. We are settled.
The customs officials will speak English, we hope,
and leave us our bourbon and cigarettes.
Ports are necessities, like postage stamps, or soap,

but they seldom seem to care what impression they make,
or, like this, only attempt, since it does not matter,
the unassertive colors of soap, or postage stamps—
wasting away like the former, slipping the way the latter

do when we mail the letteres we wrote on the boat,
either because the glue here is very inferior
or because of the heat. We leave Santos at once;
we are driving to the interior.

Although it is a cold evening, 
down by one of the fishhouses 
an old man sits netting, 
his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, 
a dark purple-brown, 
and his shuttle worn and polished. 
The air smells so strong of codfish 
it makes one’s nose run and one’s eyes water. 
The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs 
and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up 
to storerooms in the gables 
for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. 
All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, 
swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, 
is opaque, but the silver of the benches, 
the lobster pots, and masts, scattered 
among the wild jagged rocks, 
is of an apparent translucence 
like the small old buildings with an emerald moss 
growing on their shoreward walls. 
The big fish tubs are completely lined 
with layers of beautiful herring scales 
and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered 
with creamy iridescent coats of mail, 
with small iridescent flies crawling on them. 
Up on the little slope behind the houses, 
set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, 
is an ancient wooden capstan, 
cracked, with two long bleached handles 
and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, 
where the ironwork has rusted. 
The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. 
He was a friend of my grandfather. 
We talk of the decline in the population 
and of codfish and herring 
while he waits for a herring boat to come in. 
There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. 
He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, 
from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, 
the blade of which is almost worn away. 

Down at the water’s edge, at the place 
where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp 
descending into the water, thin silver 
tree trunks are laid horizontally 
across the gray stones, down and down 
at intervals of four or five feet. 

Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, 
element bearable to no mortal, 
to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly 
I have seen here evening after evening. 
He was curious about me. He was interested in music; 
like me a believer in total immersion, 
so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. 
I also sang “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.” 
He stood up in the water and regarded me 
steadily, moving his head a little. 
Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge 
almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug 
as if it were against his better judgment. 
Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, 
the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us, 
the dignified tall firs begin. 
Bluish, associating with their shadows, 
a million Christmas trees stand 
waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended 
above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. 
I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, 
slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, 
icily free above the stones, 
above the stones and then the world. 
If you should dip your hand in, 
your wrist would ache immediately, 
your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn 
as if the water were a transmutation of fire 
that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. 
If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, 
then briny, then surely burn your tongue. 
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: 
dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, 
drawn from the cold hard mouth 
of the world, derived from the rocky breasts 
forever, flowing and drawn, and since 
our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.

A new volcano has erupted, 
the papers say, and last week I was reading   
where some ship saw an island being born:   
at first a breath of steam, ten miles away;   
and then a black fleck—basalt, probably— 
rose in the mate’s binoculars 
and caught on the horizon like a fly. 
They named it. But my poor old island’s still   
un-rediscovered, un-renamable. 
None of the books has ever got it right. 

Well, I had fifty-two 
miserable, small volcanoes I could climb   
with a few slithery strides— 
volcanoes dead as ash heaps. 
I used to sit on the edge of the highest one   
and count the others standing up, 
naked and leaden, with their heads blown off.   
I’d think that if they were the size   
I thought volcanoes should be, then I had   
become a giant; 
and if I had become a giant, 
I couldn’t bear to think what size   
the goats and turtles were, 
or the gulls, or the overlapping rollers   
—a glittering hexagon of rollers   
closing and closing in, but never quite,   
glittering and glittering, though the sky   
was mostly overcast. 

My island seemed to be 
a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere’s   
left-over clouds arrived and hung 
above the craters—their parched throats   
were hot to touch. 
Was that why it rained so much? 
And why sometimes the whole place hissed?   
The turtles lumbered by, high-domed,   
hissing like teakettles. 
(And I’d have given years, or taken a few,   
for any sort of kettle, of course.) 
The folds of lava, running out to sea, 
would hiss. I’d turn. And then they’d prove   
to be more turtles. 
The beaches were all lava, variegated,   
black, red, and white, and gray; 
the marbled colors made a fine display.   
And I had waterspouts. Oh, 
half a dozen at a time, far out, 
they’d come and go, advancing and retreating,   
their heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches   
of scuffed-up white. 
Glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,   
sacerdotal beings of glass ... I watched   
the water spiral up in them like smoke.   
Beautiful, yes, but not much company. 

I often gave way to self-pity. 
“Do I deserve this? I suppose I must. 
I wouldn’t be here otherwise. Was there   
a moment when I actually chose this? 
I don’t remember, but there could have been.”   
What’s wrong about self-pity, anyway? 
With my legs dangling down familiarly   
over a crater’s edge, I told myself 
“Pity should begin at home.” So the more   
pity I felt, the more I felt at home. 

The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun   
rose from the sea, 
and there was one of it and one of me.   
The island had one kind of everything:   
one tree snail, a bright violet-blue 
with a thin shell, crept over everything,   
over the one variety of tree, 
a sooty, scrub affair. 
Snail shells lay under these in drifts   
and, at a distance, 
you’d swear that they were beds of irises.   
There was one kind of berry, a dark red.   
I tried it, one by one, and hours apart.   
Sub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects;   
and so I made home-brew. I’d drink   
the awful, fizzy, stinging stuff 
that went straight to my head 
and play my home-made flute 
(I think it had the weirdest scale on earth)   
and, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats.   
Home-made, home-made! But aren’t we all?   
I felt a deep affection for 
the smallest of my island industries.   
No, not exactly, since the smallest was   
a miserable philosophy. 

Because I didn’t know enough. 
Why didn’t I know enough of something?   
Greek drama or astronomy? The books   
I’d read were full of blanks; 
the poems—well, I tried 
reciting to my iris-beds, 
“They flash upon that inward eye, 
which is the bliss ...” The bliss of what?   
One of the first things that I did 
when I got back was look it up. 

The island smelled of goat and guano.   
The goats were white, so were the gulls,   
and both too tame, or else they thought   
I was a goat, too, or a gull. 
Baa, baa, baa and shriek, shriek, shriek, 
baa ... shriek ...

Oh, but it is dirty! 
—this little filling station, 
oil-soaked, oil-permeated 
to a disturbing, over-all 
black translucency. 
Be careful with that match! 

Father wears a dirty, 
oil-soaked monkey suit 
that cuts him under the arms, 
and several quick and saucy 
and greasy sons assist him 
(it’s a family filling station), 
all quite thoroughly dirty. 

Do they live in the station? 
It has a cement porch 
behind the pumps, and on it 
a set of crushed and grease- 
impregnated wickerwork; 
on the wicker sofa 
a dirty dog, quite comfy. 

Some comic books provide 
the only note of color— 
of certain color. They lie 
upon a big dim doily 
draping a taboret 
(part of the set), beside 
a big hirsute begonia. 

Why the extraneous plant? 
Why the taboret? 
Why, oh why, the doily? 
(Embroidered in daisy stitch 
with marguerites, I think, 
and heavy with gray crochet.) 

Somebody embroidered the doily. 
Somebody waters the plant, 
or oils it, maybe. Somebody 
arranges the rows of cans 
so that they softly say: 
esso—so—so—so 
to high-strung automobiles. 
Somebody loves us all.

for Thomas Edwards Wanning
Think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily 
like a dog looking for a place to sleep in, 
listen to it growling.

Think how they must look now, the mangrove keys
lying out there unresponsive to the lightning
in dark, coarse-fibred families,

where occasionally a heron may undo his head,
shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment
when the surrounding water shines.

Think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed
as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.

It is raining there. The boulevard
and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack
are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.

Now the storm goes away again in a series
of small, badly lit battle-scenes,
each in "Another part of the field."

Think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge;
think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.

The art of losing isn’t hard to master; 
so many things seem filled with the intent 
to be lost that their loss is no disaster. 

Lose something every day. Accept the fluster 
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. 
The art of losing isn’t hard to master. 

Then practice losing farther, losing faster: 
places, and names, and where it was you meant 
to travel. None of these will bring disaster. 

I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or 
next-to-last, of three loved houses went. 
The art of losing isn’t hard to master. 

I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, 
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. 
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster. 

—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture 
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident 
the art of losing’s not too hard to master 
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

At four o’clock 
in the gun-metal blue dark 
we hear the first crow of the first cock 

just below 
the gun-metal blue window 
and immediately there is an echo 

off in the distance, 
then one from the backyard fence,   
then one, with horrible insistence, 

grates like a wet match   
from the broccoli patch, 
flares, and all over town begins to catch. 

Cries galore 
come from the water-closet door, 
from the dropping-plastered henhouse floor, 

where in the blue blur   
their rustling wives admire, 
the roosters brace their cruel feet and glare 

with stupid eyes 
while from their beaks there rise   
the uncontrolled, traditional cries. 

Deep from protruding chests   
in green-gold medals dressed, 
planned to command and terrorize the rest, 

the many wives   
who lead hens’ lives 
of being courted and despised; 

deep from raw throats   
a senseless order floats 
all over town. A rooster gloats 

over our beds 
from rusty iron sheds 
and fences made from old bedsteads, 

over our churches 
where the tin rooster perches, 
over our little wooden northern houses, 

making sallies 
from all the muddy alleys, 
marking out maps like Rand McNally’s: 

glass-headed pins, 
oil-golds and copper greens,   
anthracite blues, alizarins, 

each one an active   
displacement in perspective; 
each screaming, “This is where I live!” 

Each screaming 
“Get up! Stop dreaming!”   
Roosters, what are you projecting? 

You, whom the Greeks elected 
to shoot at on a post, who struggled   
when sacrificed, you whom they labeled 

“Very combative ...” 
what right have you to give   
commands and tell us how to live, 

cry “Here!” and “Here!”   
and wake us here where are   
unwanted love, conceit and war? 

The crown of red 
set on your little head 
is charged with all your fighting blood. 

Yes, that excrescence 
makes a most virile presence, 
plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence. 

Now in mid-air 
by twos they fight each other.   
Down comes a first flame-feather, 

and one is flying, 
with raging heroism defying   
even the sensation of dying. 

And one has fallen, 
but still above the town 
his torn-out, bloodied feathers drift down; 

and what he sung 
no matter. He is flung 
on the gray ash-heap, lies in dung 

with his dead wives   
with open, bloody eyes, 
while those metallic feathers oxidize. 

St. Peter’s sin 
was worse than that of Magdalen   
whose sin was of the flesh alone; 

of spirit, Peter’s, 
falling, beneath the flares, 
among the “servants and officers.” 

Old holy sculpture   
could set it all together 
in one small scene, past and future: 

Christ stands amazed,   
Peter, two fingers raised 
to surprised lips, both as if dazed. 

But in between 
a little cock is seen 
carved on a dim column in the travertine, 

explained by gallus canit; 
flet Petrus underneath it. 
There is inescapable hope, the pivot; 

yes, and there Peter’s tears   
run down our chanticleer’s   
sides and gem his spurs. 

Tear-encrusted thick   
as a medieval relic 
he waits. Poor Peter, heart-sick, 

still cannot guess 
those cock-a-doodles yet might bless, 
his dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness, 

a new weathervane   
on basilica and barn, 
and that outside the Lateran 

there would always be 
a bronze cock on a porphyry 
pillar so the people and the Pope might see 

that even the Prince 
of the Apostles long since 
had been forgiven, and to convince 

all the assembly 
that “Deny deny deny” 
is not all the roosters cry. 

In the morning 
a low light is floating 
in the backyard, and gilding 

from underneath 
the broccoli, leaf by leaf; 
how could the night have come to grief? 

gilding the tiny   
floating swallow’s belly 
and lines of pink cloud in the sky, 

the day’s preamble 
like wandering lines in marble. 
The cocks are now almost inaudible. 

The sun climbs in,   
following “to see the end,”   
faithful as enemy, or friend.

for Robert Lowell
This is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
Climbing the mountain height,

rising toward a saint
still honored in these parts,
the paper chambers flush and fill with light
that comes and goes, like hearts.

Once up against the sky it's hard
to tell them from the stars—
planets, that is—the tinted ones:
Venus going down, or Mars,

or the pale green one. With a wind,
they flare and falter, wobble and toss;
but if it's still they steer between
the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us,
or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

Last night another big one fell.
It splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house.
The flame ran down. We saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until
they shrieked up out of sight.

The ancient owls' nest must have burned.
Hastily, all alone,
a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
short-eared, to our surprise.
So soft!—a handful of intangible ash
with fixed, ignited eyes.

Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!
O falling fire and piercing cry 
and panic, and a weak mailed fist
clenched ignorant against the sky!

Man-Moth: Newspaper misprint for “mammoth.”
Here, above, 
cracks in the buildings are filled with battered moonlight. 
The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat. 
It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on, 
and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon. 
He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties, 
feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold, 
of a temperature impossible to record in thermometers. 

                     But when the Man-Moth 
pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface, 
the moon looks rather different to him. He emerges 
from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks 
and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings. 
He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky, 
proving the sky quite useless for protection. 
He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb. 

                     Up the façades, 
his shadow dragging like a photographer’s cloth behind him 
he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage 
to push his small head through that round clean opening 
and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light. 
(Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.) 
But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although 
he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt. 

                     Then he returns 
to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits, 
he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains 
fast enough to suit him. The doors close swiftly. 
The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way 
and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed, 
without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort. 
He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards. 

                     Each night he must 
be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams. 
Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie 
his rushing brain. He does not dare look out the window, 
for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison, 
runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease 
he has inherited the susceptibility to. He has to keep 
his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers. 

                     If you catch him, 
hold up a flashlight to his eye. It’s all dark pupil, 
an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens 
as he stares back, and closes up the eye. Then from the lids 
one tear, his only possession, like the bee’s sting, slips. 
Slyly he palms it, and if you’re not paying attention 
he’ll swallow it. However, if you watch, he’ll hand it over, 
cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.

For Grace Bulmer Bowers
From narrow provinces   
of fish and bread and tea,   
home of the long tides 
where the bay leaves the sea   
twice a day and takes 
the herrings long rides, 

where if the river 
enters or retreats 
in a wall of brown foam   
depends on if it meets   
the bay coming in, 
the bay not at home; 

where, silted red, 
sometimes the sun sets   
facing a red sea, 
and others, veins the flats’   
lavender, rich mud 
in burning rivulets; 

on red, gravelly roads, 
down rows of sugar maples,   
past clapboard farmhouses   
and neat, clapboard churches,   
bleached, ridged as clamshells,   
past twin silver birches, 

through late afternoon 
a bus journeys west, 
the windshield flashing pink,   
pink glancing off of metal,   
brushing the dented flank   
of blue, beat-up enamel; 

down hollows, up rises,   
and waits, patient, while   
a lone traveller gives   
kisses and embraces 
to seven relatives 
and a collie supervises. 

Goodbye to the elms,   
to the farm, to the dog.   
The bus starts. The light   
grows richer; the fog,   
shifting, salty, thin, 
comes closing in. 

Its cold, round crystals   
form and slide and settle   
in the white hens’ feathers,   
in gray glazed cabbages,   
on the cabbage roses 
and lupins like apostles; 

the sweet peas cling 
to their wet white string   
on the whitewashed fences;   
bumblebees creep 
inside the foxgloves, 
and evening commences. 

One stop at Bass River.   
Then the Economies— 
Lower, Middle, Upper;   
Five Islands, Five Houses, 
where a woman shakes a tablecloth   
out after supper. 

A pale flickering. Gone.   
The Tantramar marshes   
and the smell of salt hay.   
An iron bridge trembles   
and a loose plank rattles   
but doesn’t give way. 

On the left, a red light   
swims through the dark:   
a ship’s port lantern.   
Two rubber boots show,   
illuminated, solemn.   
A dog gives one bark. 

A woman climbs in 
with two market bags,   
brisk, freckled, elderly.   
“A grand night. Yes, sir,   
all the way to Boston.”   
She regards us amicably. 

Moonlight as we enter 
the New Brunswick woods,   
hairy, scratchy, splintery;   
moonlight and mist 
caught in them like lamb’s wool   
on bushes in a pasture. 

The passengers lie back.   
Snores. Some long sighs.   
A dreamy divagation   
begins in the night, 
a gentle, auditory, 
slow hallucination.... 

In the creakings and noises,   
an old conversation 
—not concerning us, 
but recognizable, somewhere,   
back in the bus: 
Grandparents’ voices 

uninterruptedly 
talking, in Eternity: 
names being mentioned,   
things cleared up finally;   
what he said, what she said,   
who got pensioned; 

deaths, deaths and sicknesses;   
the year he remarried; 
the year (something) happened.   
She died in childbirth. 
That was the son lost 
when the schooner foundered. 

He took to drink. Yes. 
She went to the bad. 
When Amos began to pray   
even in the store and 
finally the family had 
to put him away. 

“Yes ...” that peculiar   
affirmative. “Yes ...” 
A sharp, indrawn breath,   
half groan, half acceptance,   
that means “Life’s like that.   
We know it (also death).” 

Talking the way they talked   
in the old featherbed,   
peacefully, on and on, 
dim lamplight in the hall,   
down in the kitchen, the dog   
tucked in her shawl. 

Now, it’s all right now   
even to fall asleep 
just as on all those nights.   
—Suddenly the bus driver   
stops with a jolt, 
turns off his lights. 

A moose has come out of 
the impenetrable wood 
and stands there, looms, rather,   
in the middle of the road. 
It approaches; it sniffs at 
the bus’s hot hood. 

Towering, antlerless,   
high as a church, 
homely as a house 
(or, safe as houses). 
A man’s voice assures us   
“Perfectly harmless....” 

Some of the passengers   
exclaim in whispers,   
childishly, softly, 
“Sure are big creatures.”   
“It’s awful plain.”   
“Look! It’s a she!” 

Taking her time, 
she looks the bus over,   
grand, otherworldly.   
Why, why do we feel   
(we all feel) this sweet   
sensation of joy? 

“Curious creatures,” 
says our quiet driver,   
rolling his r’s. 
“Look at that, would you.”   
Then he shifts gears. 
For a moment longer, 

by craning backward,   
the moose can be seen 
on the moonlit macadam;   
then there’s a dim 
smell of moose, an acrid   
smell of gasoline.

to see if the world is round or flat.
This is a Jew in a newspaper hat
that dances carefully down the ward,
walking the plank of a coffin board
with the crazy sailor
that shows his watch
that tells the time
of the wretched man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.
