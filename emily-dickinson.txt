For Gentlemen who see! 
But Microscopes are prudent 
In an Emergency!

“Hope” is the thing with feathers - 
That perches in the soul - 
And sings the tune without the words - 
And never stops - at all - 

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard - 
And sore must be the storm - 
That could abash the little Bird 
That kept so many warm - 

I’ve heard it in the chillest land - 
And on the strangest Sea - 
Yet - never - in Extremity, 
It asked a crumb - of me.
#END#
A Bird, came down the Walk - 
 He did not know I saw -
 He bit an Angle Worm in halves 
 And ate the fellow, raw, 
  
 And then, he drank a Dew
 From a convenient Grass -
 And then hopped sidewise to the Wall 
 To let a Beetle pass -
  
 He glanced with rapid eyes,
 That hurried all abroad -
 They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,
 He stirred his Velvet Head. - 
  
 Like one in danger, Cautious,
 I offered him a Crumb,
 And he unrolled his feathers, 
 And rowed him softer Home -
  
 Than Oars divide the Ocean,
 Too silver for a seam,
 Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, 
 Leap, plashless as they swim.
#END#
The morns are meeker than they were - 
 The nuts are getting brown -
 The berry’s cheek is plumper -
 The rose is out of town. 
  
 The maple wears a gayer scarf -
 The field a scarlet gown -
 Lest I sh'd be old-fashioned 
 I’ll put a trinket on.

A little East of Jordan, 
Evangelists record, 
A Gymnast and an Angel 
Did wrestle long and hard – 

Till morning touching mountain – 
And Jacob, waxing strong, 
The Angel begged permission 
To Breakfast – to return! 

Not so, said cunning Jacob! 
"I will not let thee go 
Except thou bless me" – Stranger! 
The which acceded to – 

Light swung the silver fleeces 
"Peniel" Hills beyond, 
And the bewildered Gymnast 
Found he had worsted God!
#END#
A narrow fellow in the grass 
Occasionally rides; 
You may have met him—did you not 
His notice sudden is, 
 The grass divides as with a comb, 
A spotted shaft is seen, 
And then it closes at your feet, 
And opens further on.

He likes a boggy acre,   
A floor too cool for corn,
But when a boy and barefoot, 
I more than once at noon 
Have passed, I thought, a whip lash, 
Unbraiding in the sun, 
When stooping to secure it, 
It wrinkled and was gone. 

Several of nature’s people 
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport 
Of cordiality. 
 But never met this fellow, 
Attended or alone, 
Without a tighter breathing, 
And zero at the bone.
#END#
A not admitting of the wound
Until it grew so wide
That all my Life had entered it
And there were troughs beside - 

A closing of the simple lid that opened to the sun
Until the tender Carpenter
Perpetual nail it down -
#END#
A Route of Evanescence, 
With a revolving Wheel – 
A Resonance of Emerald 
A Rush of Cochineal – 
And every Blossom on the Bush 
Adjusts it’s tumbled Head – 
The Mail from Tunis – probably, 
An easy Morning’s Ride –
#END#
After great pain, a formal feeling comes – 
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs – 
The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He, that bore,’ 
And ‘Yesterday, or Centuries before’? 

The Feet, mechanical, go round – 
A Wooden way 
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought – 
Regardless grown, 
A Quartz contentment, like a stone – 

This is the Hour of Lead – 
Remembered, if outlived, 
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow – 
First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go –
#END#
All overgrown by cunning moss, 
All interspersed with weed, 
The little cage of “Currer Bell” 
In quiet “Haworth” laid. 

This Bird – observing others 
When frosts too sharp became 
Retire to other latitudes – 
Quietly did the same – 

But differed in returning – 
Since Yorkshire hills are green – 
Yet not in all the nests I meet – 
Can Nightingale be seen –
#END#
Banish Air from Air -
Divide Light if you dare -
They'll meet
While Cubes in a Drop
Or Pellets of Shape
Fit -
Films cannot annul
Odors return whole
Force Flame
And with a Blonde push
Over your impotence
Flits Steam.

Because I could not stop for Death – 
He kindly stopped for me – 
The Carriage held but just Ourselves – 
And Immortality. 

We slowly drove – He knew no haste 
And I had put away 
My labor and my leisure too, 
For His Civility – 

We passed the School, where Children strove 
At Recess – in the Ring – 
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain – 
We passed the Setting Sun – 

Or rather – He passed Us – 
The Dews drew quivering and Chill – 
For only Gossamer, my Gown – 
My Tippet – only Tulle – 

We paused before a House that seemed 
A Swelling of the Ground – 
The Roof was scarcely visible – 
The Cornice – in the Ground – 

Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet 
Feels shorter than the Day 
I first surmised the Horses' Heads 
Were toward Eternity –
#END#
Before I got my eye put out – 
I liked as well to see 
As other creatures, that have eyes – 
And know no other way – 

But were it told to me, Today, 
That I might have the Sky 
For mine, I tell you that my Heart 
Would split, for size of me – 

The Meadows – mine – 
The Mountains – mine – 
All Forests – Stintless stars – 
As much of noon, as I could take – 
Between my finite eyes – 

The Motions of the Dipping Birds – 
The Morning’s Amber Road – 
For mine – to look at when I liked, 
The news would strike me dead – 

So safer – guess – with just my soul 
Opon the window pane 
Where other creatures put their eyes – 
Incautious – of the Sun –
#END#
Come slowly – Eden! 
Lips unused to Thee – 
Bashful – sip thy Jessamines – 
As the fainting Bee – 

Reaching late his flower, 
Round her chamber hums – 
Counts his nectars – 
Enters – and is lost in Balms.

Crumbling is not an instant's Act
A fundamental pause
Dilapidation's processes
Are organized Decays —

'Tis first a Cobweb on the Soul
A Cuticle of Dust
A Borer in the Axis
An Elemental Rust —

Ruin is formal — Devil's work
Consecutive and slow —
Fail in an instant, no man did
Slipping — is Crashe's law —

Fame is a fickle food 
Upon a shifting plate

Guest but not 
The second time is set 
Whose crumbs the crows inspect

Flap past it to the 
Farmer’s corn 
Men eat of it and die

It's occupant must die
Or out of sight of estimate
Ascend incessantly —

Glass was the Street - in Tinsel Peril
Tree and Traveller stood.
Filled was the Air with merry venture
Hearty with Boys the Road.

Shot the lithe Sleds like Shod vibrations
Emphacized and gone

Makes the Present mean -

How many times these low feet staggered -
Only the soldered mouth can tell -
Try - can you stir the awful rivet -

Handle the adamantine fingers 
Never a thimble - more - shall wear - 

Buzz the dull flies - on the chamber window - 
Brave - shines the sun through the freckled pane - 
Fearless - the cobweb swings from the ceiling - 
Indolent Housewife - in Daisies - lain!

I dwell in Possibility – 
A fairer House than Prose – 
More numerous of Windows – 
Superior – for Doors – 

Of Chambers as the Cedars – 
Impregnable of eye – 
And for an everlasting Roof

Of Visitors – the fairest – 
For Occupation – This –

To gather Paradise –

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, 
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed 
That Sense was breaking through - 

And when they all were seated, 
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought 
My mind was going numb - 

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul 
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell, 
And Being, but an Ear, 
And I, and Silence, some strange Race, 
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke, 
And I dropped down, and down - 
And hit a World, at every plunge, 
And Finished knowing - then -
#END#
I heard a Fly buzz - when I died -
The Stillness in the Room 
Was like the Stillness in the Air -
Between the Heaves of Storm - 

The Eyes around - had wrung them dry - 
And Breaths were gathering firm 
For that last Onset - when the King 
Be witnessed - in the Room -

I willed my Keepsakes - Signed away 
What portion of me be 
Assignable - and then it was 
There interposed a Fly - 

With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -
Between the light - and me -
And then the Windows failed - and then 
I could not see to see -
#END#
I know that He exists. 
Somewhere – in silence – 
He has hid his rare life 
From our gross eyes. 

’Tis an instant’s play – 
’Tis a fond Ambush – 
Just to make Bliss 
Earn her own surprise! 

But – should the play 
Prove piercing earnest – 
Should the glee – glaze – 
In Death’s – stiff – stare – 

Would not the fun 
Look too expensive! 
Would not the jest – 
Have crawled too far!

I like to see it lap the Miles -
And lick the Valleys up - 
And stop to feed itself at Tanks - 
And then - prodigious step

Around a Pile of Mountains - 
And supercilious peer
In Shanties - by the sides of Roads - 
And then a Quarry pare

To fit it's sides
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid - hooting stanza - 
Then chase itself down Hill - 

And neigh like Boanerges - 
Then - prompter than a Star
Stop - docile and omnipotent
At it's own stable door -
#END#
I never hear that one is dead
Without the chance of Life
Afresh annihilating me
That mightiest Belief,

Too mighty for the Daily mind
That tilling it’s abyss,
Had Madness, had it once or, Twice
The yawning Consciousness,

Beliefs are Bandaged, like the Tongue
When Terror were it told
In any Tone commensurate
Would strike us instant Dead - 

I do not know the man so bold
He dare in lonely Place
That awful stranger - Consciousness
Deliberately face -
#END#
I never hear the word “Escape” 
Without a quicker blood, 
A sudden expectation – 
A flying attitude! 

I never hear of prisons broad 
By soldiers battered down, 
But I tug childish at my bars 
Only to fail again!

I started Early – Took my Dog – 
And visited the Sea – 
The Mermaids in the BasementBasement i.e., the bottom of the ocean 
Came out to look at me – 

And FrigatesFrigates fast and highly maneuverable warships of the 18th and 19th centuries, used to escort other larger ships, or to patrol the coast and blockade harbors – in the Upper Floor 
Extended Hempen HandsHempen Hands strong, thick ropes made of hemp, used on ships – 
Presuming Me to be a Mouse – 
Aground – oponopon upon the Sands – 

But no Man moved Me – till the Tide 
Went past my simple Shoe – 
And past my Apron – and my Belt 
And past my BoddiceBoddice bodice; an upper part of a woman’s dress, or a rigid, laced corset worn underneath clothing, covering the upper part of a woman’s body – too – 

And made as He would eat me up – 
As wholly as a Dew 
Opon a Dandelion's Sleeve – 
And then – I started – too – 

And He – He followed – close behind – 
I felt His Silver Heel 
Opon my Ancle – Then My Shoes 
Would overflow with Pearl – 

Until We met the Solid Town – 
No One He seemed to know – 
And bowing – with a Mighty look – 
At me – The Sea withdrew –

I would not paint — a picture — 
I'd rather be the One
It's bright impossibility
To dwell — delicious — on —
And wonder how the fingers feel
Whose rare — celestial — stir —
Evokes so sweet a torment — 
Such sumptuous — Despair —

I would not talk, like Cornets —
I'd rather be the One
Raised softly to the Ceilings —
And out, and easy on —
Through Villages of Ether —
Myself endued Balloon
By but a lip of Metal —
The pier to my Pontoon —

Nor would I be a Poet —
It's finer — Own the Ear —
Enamored — impotent — content —
The License to revere,
A privilege so awful 
What would the Dower be,
Had I the Art to stun myself
With Bolts — of Melody!

How much - how little - is within our power

It sifts from Leaden Sieves -
It powders all the Wood. 
It fills with Alabaster Wool 
The Wrinkles of the Road -

It makes an even Face 
Of Mountain, and of Plain -
Unbroken Forehead from the East 
Unto the East again -

It reaches to the Fence -
It wraps it Rail by Rail 
Till it is lost in Fleeces -
It deals Celestial Vail 

To Stump, and Stack - and Stem -
A Summer’s empty Room - 
Acres of Joints, where Harvests were, 
Recordless, but for them -

It Ruffles Wrists of Posts 
As Ankles of a Queen -
Then stills it’s Artisans - like Ghosts - 
Denying they have been -

It was not Death, for I stood up, 
And all the Dead, lie down - 
It was not Night, for all the Bells 
Put out their Tongues, for Noon. 

It was not Frost, for on my Flesh 
I felt Siroccos - crawl -
Nor Fire - for just my marble feet 
Could keep a Chancel, cool - 

And yet, it tasted, like them all, 
The Figures I have seen 
Set orderly, for Burial 
Reminded me, of mine - 

As if my life were shaven,
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key, 
And ’twas like Midnight, some -

When everything that ticked - has stopped -
And space stares - all around -
Or Grisly frosts - first Autumn morns,
Repeal the Beating Ground -

But most, like Chaos - Stopless - cool - 
Without a Chance, or spar -
Or even a Report of Land -
To justify - Despair.

The Mountains straight reply -

And do I smile, such cordial light
Opon the Valley glow -
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let it’s pleasure through -

And when at Night - Our good Day done -
I guard My Master’s Head -
’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
Deep Pillow - to have shared -

To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
None stir the second time -
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
Or an emphatic Thumb -

Though I than He - may longer live
He longer must - than I -
For I have but the power to kill,
Without - the power to die -

Now I knew I lost her —
Not that she was gone —
But Remoteness travelled
On her Face and Tongue. 

Alien, though adjoining
As a Foreign Race —
Traversed she though pausing
Latitudeless Place.

Elements Unaltered —
Universe the same
But Love's transmigration —
Somehow this had come —

Henceforth to remember
Nature took the Day
I had paid so much for —
His is Penury
Not who toils for Freedom
Or for Family
But the Restitution
Of Idolatry.
