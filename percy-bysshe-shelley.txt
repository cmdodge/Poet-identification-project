To Mary — —
                                          1.


  So now my summer task is ended, Mary,
       And I return to thee, mine own heart's home; 
   As to his Queen some victor Knight of Faëry,
       Earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome;
       Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become 
   A star among the stars of mortal night,
       If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom, 
   Its doubtful promise thus I would unite 
With thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.


                                         2.


   The toil which stole from thee so many an hour 
       Is ended,—and the fruit is at thy feet!
   No longer where the woods to frame a bower 
       With interlaced branches mix and meet, 
       Or where with sound like many voices sweet,
   Water-falls leap among wild islands green,
       Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat
   Of moss-grown trees and weeds, shall I be seen: 
But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.


                                         3.


   Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear Friend, when first 
       The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.
   I do remember well the hour which burst 
       My spirit's sleep: a fresh May-dawn it was, 
       When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,
   And wept, I knew not why; until there rose 
       From the near school-room, voices, that, alas!
   Were but one echo from a world of woes— 
The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.


                                         4.


   And then I clasped my hands and looked around—
       —But none was near to mock my streaming eyes, 
   Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground—
       So without shame, I spake:—"I will be wise,
       And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies 
   Such power, for I grow weary to behold
       The selfish and the strong still tyrannise 
   Without reproach or check." I then controuled 
My tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.


                                         5.


   And from that hour did I with earnest thought
       Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore, 
   Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught
       I cared to learn, but from that secret store
       Wrought linked armour for my soul, before 
   It might walk forth to war among mankind;
       Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more
   Within me, till there came upon my mind
A sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined.


                                         6.


   Alas, that love should be a blight and snare
       To those who seek all sympathies in one!— 
   Such once I sought in vain; then black despair,
       The shadow of a starless night, was thrown
       Over the world in which I moved alone:—
   Yet never found I one not false to me,
       Hard hearts, and cold, like weights of icy stone 
   Which crushed and withered mine, that could not be 
Aught but a lifeless clog, until revived by thee.


                                         7.


   Thou Friend, whose presence on my wintry heart 
       Fell, like bright Spring upon some herbless plain;
   How beautiful and calm and free thou wert 
       In thy young wisdom, when the mortal chain 
       Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,
   And walked as free as light the clouds among,
       Which many an envious slave then breathed in vain
   From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprung 
To meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long.


                                         8.


   No more alone through the world's wilderness, 
       Although I trod the paths of high intent,
   I journeyed now: no more companionless, 
       Where solitude is like despair, I went.— 
       There is the wisdom of a stern content
   When Poverty can blight the just and good, 
       When Infamy dares mock the innocent,
   And cherished friends turn with the multitude 
To trample: this was ours, and we unshaken stood!


                                         9.


   Now has descended a serener hour,
       And with inconstant fortune, friends return;
   Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power
       Which says:—Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.
       And from thy side two gentle babes are born 
   To fill our home with smiles, and thus are we
      Most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn;
   And these delights, and thou, have been to me
The parents of the Song I consecrate to thee.


                                         10.


   Is it, that now my inexperienced fingers
       But strike the prelude of a loftier strain? 
   Or, must the lyre on which my spirit lingers
       Soon pause in silence, ne'er to sound again,
       Though it might shake the Anarch Custom's reign, 
   And charm the minds of men to Truth's own sway
       Holier than was Amphion's? I would fain
   Reply in hope—but I am worn away, 
And Death and Love are yet contending for their prey.


                                         11.


   And what art thou? I know, but dare not speak: 
       Time may interpret to his silent years.
   Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek, 
       And in the light thine ample forehead wears, 
       And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears,
  And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy
       Is whispered, to subdue my fondest fears:
   And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I see 
A lamp of vestal fire burning internally.


                                         12.


   They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth, 
       Of glorious parents, thou aspiring Child.
   I wonder not—for One then left this earth
       Whose life was like a setting planet mild 
       Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled
   Of its departing glory; still her fame
       Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild
   Which shake these latter days; and thou canst claim 
The shelter, from thy Sire, of an immortal name.


                                         13.


   One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit, 
       Which was the echo of three thousand years;
   And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it, 
       As some lone man who in a desart hears 
       The music of his home:—unwonted fears
   Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,
       And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,
   Like thunder-stricken dragons, for a space 
Left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.


                                         14.


   Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!
       If there must be no response to my cry— 
   If men must rise and stamp with fury blind
       On his pure name who loves them,—thou and I,
       Sweet Friend! can look from our tranquillity
   Like lamps into the world's tempestuous night,—
       Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by
   Which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight,
That burn from year to year with unextinguished light.
#END#
O world! O life! O time!
On whose last steps I climb,
      Trembling at that where I had stood before;
When will return the glory of your prime?
         No moreOh, never more!

   Out of the day and night
A joy has taken flight;
      Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar,
Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight
         No moreOh, never more!
#END#
Men of England, wherefore plough
For the lords who lay ye low?
Wherefore weave with toil and care
The rich robes your tyrants wear?

Wherefore feed and clothe and save
From the cradle to the grave
Those ungrateful drones who would
Drain your sweat—nay, drink your blood?

Wherefore, Bees of England, forge
Many a weapon, chain, and scourge,
That these stingless drones may spoil
The forced produce of your toil?

Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,
Shelter, food, love’s gentle balm?
Or what is it ye buy so dear
With your pain and with your fear?

The seed ye sow, another reaps;
The wealth ye find, another keeps;
The robes ye weave, another wears;
The arms ye forge, another bears.

Sow seed—but let no tyrant reap:
Find wealth—let no imposter heap:
Weave robes—let not the idle wear:
Forge arms—in your defence to bear.

Shrink to your cellars, holes, and cells—
In hall ye deck another dwells.
Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see
The steel ye tempered glance on ye.

With plough and spade and hoe and loom
Trace your grave and build your tomb
And weave your winding-sheet—till fair
England be your Sepulchre.
#END#
I 
       I weep for Adonais—he is dead! 
       Oh, weep for Adonais! though our tears 
       Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head! 
       And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years 
       To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers, 
       And teach them thine own sorrow, say: "With me 
       Died Adonais; till the Future dares 
       Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be 
An echo and a light unto eternity!" 

II 
       Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay, 
       When thy Son lay, pierc'd by the shaft which flies 
       In darkness? where was lorn Urania 
       When Adonais died? With veiled eyes, 
       'Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise 
       She sate, while one, with soft enamour'd breath, 
       Rekindled all the fading melodies, 
       With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath, 
He had adorn'd and hid the coming bulk of Death. 

III 
       Oh, weep for Adonais—he is dead! 
       Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep! 
       Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed 
       Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep 
       Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep; 
       For he is gone, where all things wise and fair 
       Descend—oh, dream not that the amorous Deep 
       Will yet restore him to the vital air; 
Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair. 

IV 
       Most musical of mourners, weep again! 
       Lament anew, Urania! He died, 
       Who was the Sire of an immortal strain, 
       Blind, old and lonely, when his country's pride, 
       The priest, the slave and the liberticide, 
       Trampled and mock'd with many a loathed rite 
       Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified, 
       Into the gulf of death; but his clear Sprite 
Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light. 

V 
       Most musical of mourners, weep anew! 
       Not all to that bright station dar'd to climb; 
       And happier they their happiness who knew, 
       Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time 
       In which suns perish'd; others more sublime, 
       Struck by the envious wrath of man or god, 
       Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime; 
       And some yet live, treading the thorny road, 
Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode. 

VI 
       But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perish'd, 
       The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew, 
       Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherish'd, 
       And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew; 
       Most musical of mourners, weep anew! 
       Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last, 
       The bloom, whose petals nipp'd before they blew 
       Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste; 
The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast. 

VII 
       To that high Capital, where kingly Death 
       Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay, 
       He came; and bought, with price of purest breath, 
       A grave among the eternal.—Come away! 
       Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day 
       Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still 
       He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay; 
       Awake him not! surely he takes his fill 
Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill. 

VIII 
       He will awake no more, oh, never more! 
       Within the twilight chamber spreads apace 
       The shadow of white Death, and at the door 
       Invisible Corruption waits to trace 
       His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place; 
       The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe 
       Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface 
       So fair a prey, till darkness and the law 
Of change shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw. 

IX 
       Oh, weep for Adonais! The quick Dreams, 
       The passion-winged Ministers of thought, 
       Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams 
       Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught 
       The love which was its music, wander not— 
       Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain, 
       But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lot 
       Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain, 
They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again. 

X 
       And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head, 
       And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries, 
       "Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead; 
       See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes, 
       Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies 
       A tear some Dream has loosen'd from his brain." 
       Lost Angel of a ruin'd Paradise! 
       She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stain 
She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain. 

XI 
       One from a lucid urn of starry dew 
       Wash'd his light limbs as if embalming them; 
       Another clipp'd her profuse locks, and threw 
       The wreath upon him, like an anadem, 
       Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem; 
       Another in her wilful grief would break 
       Her bow and winged reeds, as if to stem 
       A greater loss with one which was more weak; 
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek. 

XII 
       Another Splendour on his mouth alit, 
       That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath 
       Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit, 
       And pass into the panting heart beneath 
       With lightning and with music: the damp death 
       Quench'd its caress upon his icy lips; 
       And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath 
       Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips, 
It flush'd through his pale limbs, and pass'd to its eclipse. 

XIII 
       And others came . . . Desires and Adorations, 
       Winged Persuasions and veil'd Destinies, 
       Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations 
       Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies; 
       And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs, 
       And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam 
       Of her own dying smile instead of eyes, 
       Came in slow pomp; the moving pomp might seem 
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream. 

XIV 
       All he had lov'd, and moulded into thought, 
       From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound, 
       Lamented Adonais. Morning sought 
       Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound, 
       Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground, 
       Dimm'd the aëreal eyes that kindle day; 
       Afar the melancholy thunder moan'd, 
       Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay, 
And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay. 

XV 
       Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains, 
       And feeds her grief with his remember'd lay, 
       And will no more reply to winds or fountains, 
       Or amorous birds perch'd on the young green spray, 
       Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day; 
       Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear 
       Than those for whose disdain she pin'd away 
       Into a shadow of all sounds: a drear 
Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear. 

XVI 
       Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down 
       Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were, 
       Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown, 
       For whom should she have wak'd the sullen year? 
       To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear 
       Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both 
       Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere 
       Amid the faint companions of their youth, 
With dew all turn'd to tears; odour, to sighing ruth. 

XVII 
       Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale 
       Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain; 
       Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale 
       Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain 
       Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain, 
       Soaring and screaming round her empty nest, 
       As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain 
       Light on his head who pierc'd thy innocent breast, 
And scar'd the angel soul that was its earthly guest! 

XVIII 
       Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone, 
       But grief returns with the revolving year; 
       The airs and streams renew their joyous tone; 
       The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear; 
       Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier; 
       The amorous birds now pair in every brake, 
       And build their mossy homes in field and brere; 
       And the green lizard, and the golden snake, 
Like unimprison'd flames, out of their trance awake. 

XIX 
       Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean 
       A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst 
       As it has ever done, with change and motion, 
       From the great morning of the world when first 
       God dawn'd on Chaos; in its stream immers'd, 
       The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light; 
       All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst; 
       Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight, 
The beauty and the joy of their renewed might. 

XX 
       The leprous corpse, touch'd by this spirit tender, 
       Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath; 
       Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour 
       Is chang'd to fragrance, they illumine death 
       And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath; 
       Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows 
       Be as a sword consum'd before the sheath 
       By sightless lightning?—the intense atom glows 
A moment, then is quench'd in a most cold repose. 

XXI 
       Alas! that all we lov'd of him should be, 
       But for our grief, as if it had not been, 
       And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me! 
       Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene 
       The actors or spectators? Great and mean 
       Meet mass'd in death, who lends what life must borrow. 
       As long as skies are blue, and fields are green, 
       Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow, 
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow. 

XXII 
       He will awake no more, oh, never more! 
       "Wake thou," cried Misery, "childless Mother, rise 
       Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core, 
       A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs." 
       And all the Dreams that watch'd Urania's eyes, 
       And all the Echoes whom their sister's song 
       Had held in holy silence, cried: "Arise!" 
       Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung, 
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung. 

XXIII 
       She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs 
       Out of the East, and follows wild and drear 
       The golden Day, which, on eternal wings, 
       Even as a ghost abandoning a bier, 
       Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear 
       So struck, so rous'd, so rapt Urania; 
       So sadden'd round her like an atmosphere 
       Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way 
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay. 

XXIV 
       Out of her secret Paradise she sped, 
       Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel, 
       And human hearts, which to her aery tread 
       Yielding not, wounded the invisible 
       Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell: 
       And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they, 
       Rent the soft Form they never could repel, 
       Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May, 
Pav'd with eternal flowers that undeserving way. 

XXV 
       In the death-chamber for a moment Death, 
       Sham'd by the presence of that living Might, 
       Blush'd to annihilation, and the breath 
       Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light 
       Flash'd through those limbs, so late her dear delight. 
       "Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless, 
       As silent lightning leaves the starless night! 
       Leave me not!" cried Urania: her distress 
Rous'd Death: Death rose and smil'd, and met her vain caress. 

XXVI 
       "Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again; 
       Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live; 
       And in my heartless breast and burning brain 
       That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive, 
       With food of saddest memory kept alive, 
       Now thou art dead, as if it were a part 
       Of thee, my Adonais! I would give 
       All that I am to be as thou now art! 
But I am chain'd to Time, and cannot thence depart! 

XXVII 
       "O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert, 
       Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men 
       Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart 
       Dare the unpastur'd dragon in his den? 
       Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then 
       Wisdom the mirror'd shield, or scorn the spear? 
       Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when 
       Thy spirit should have fill'd its crescent sphere, 
The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer. 

XXVIII 
       "The herded wolves, bold only to pursue; 
       The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead; 
       The vultures to the conqueror's banner true 
       Who feed where Desolation first has fed, 
       And whose wings rain contagion; how they fled, 
       When, like Apollo, from his golden bow 
       The Pythian of the age one arrow sped 
       And smil'd! The spoilers tempt no second blow, 
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low. 

XXIX 
       "The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn; 
       He sets, and each ephemeral insect then 
       Is gather'd into death without a dawn, 
       And the immortal stars awake again; 
       So is it in the world of living men: 
       A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight 
       Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when 
       It sinks, the swarms that dimm'd or shar'd its light 
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night." 

XXX 
       Thus ceas'd she: and the mountain shepherds came, 
       Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent; 
       The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame 
       Over his living head like Heaven is bent, 
       An early but enduring monument, 
       Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song 
       In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent 
       The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong, 
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue. 

XXXI 
       Midst others of less note, came one frail Form, 
       A phantom among men; companionless 
       As the last cloud of an expiring storm 
       Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess, 
       Had gaz'd on Nature's naked loveliness, 
       Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray 
       With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness, 
       And his own thoughts, along that rugged way, 
Pursu'd, like raging hounds, their father and their prey. 

XXXII 
       A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift— 
       A Love in desolation mask'd—a Power 
       Girt round with weakness—it can scarce uplift 
       The weight of the superincumbent hour; 
       It is a dying lamp, a falling shower, 
       A breaking billow; even whilst we speak 
       Is it not broken? On the withering flower 
       The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek 
The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break. 

XXXIII 
       His head was bound with pansies overblown, 
       And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue; 
       And a light spear topp'd with a cypress cone, 
       Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew 
       Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew, 
       Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart 
       Shook the weak hand that grasp'd it; of that crew 
       He came the last, neglected and apart; 
A herd-abandon'd deer struck by the hunter's dart. 

XXXIV 
       All stood aloof, and at his partial moan 
       Smil'd through their tears; well knew that gentle band 
       Who in another's fate now wept his own, 
       As in the accents of an unknown land 
       He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scann'd 
       The Stranger's mien, and murmur'd: "Who art thou?" 
       He answer'd not, but with a sudden hand 
       Made bare his branded and ensanguin'd brow, 
Which was like Cain's or Christ's—oh! that it should be so! 

XXXV 
       What softer voice is hush'd over the dead? 
       Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown? 
       What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed, 
       In mockery of monumental stone, 
       The heavy heart heaving without a moan? 
       If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise, 
       Taught, sooth'd, lov'd, honour'd the departed one, 
       Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs, 
The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice. 

XXXVI 
       Our Adonais has drunk poison—oh! 
       What deaf and viperous murderer could crown 
       Life's early cup with such a draught of woe? 
       The nameless worm would now itself disown: 
       It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone 
       Whose prelude held all envy, hate and wrong, 
       But what was howling in one breast alone, 
       Silent with expectation of the song, 
Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung. 

XXXVII 
       Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame! 
       Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me, 
       Thou noteless blot on a remember'd name! 
       But be thyself, and know thyself to be! 
       And ever at thy season be thou free 
       To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow; 
       Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee; 
       Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow, 
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt—as now. 

XXXVIII 
       Nor let us weep that our delight is fled 
       Far from these carrion kites that scream below; 
       He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead; 
       Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now. 
       Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow 
       Back to the burning fountain whence it came, 
       A portion of the Eternal, which must glow 
       Through time and change, unquenchably the same, 
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame. 

XXXIX 
       Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep, 
       He hath awaken'd from the dream of life; 
       'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep 
       With phantoms an unprofitable strife, 
       And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife 
       Invulnerable nothings.  We decay 
       Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief 
       Convulse us and consume us day by day, 
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay. 

XL 
       He has outsoar'd the shadow of our night; 
       Envy and calumny and hate and pain, 
       And that unrest which men miscall delight, 
       Can touch him not and torture not again; 
       From the contagion of the world's slow stain 
       He is secure, and now can never mourn 
       A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain; 
       Nor, when the spirit's self has ceas'd to burn, 
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn. 

XLI 
       He lives, he wakes—'tis Death is dead, not he; 
       Mourn not for Adonais. Thou young Dawn, 
       Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee 
       The spirit thou lamentest is not gone; 
       Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan! 
       Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air, 
       Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown 
       O'er the abandon'd Earth, now leave it bare 
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair! 

XLII 
       He is made one with Nature: there is heard 
       His voice in all her music, from the moan 
       Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird; 
       He is a presence to be felt and known 
       In darkness and in light, from herb and stone, 
       Spreading itself where'er that Power may move 
       Which has withdrawn his being to its own; 
       Which wields the world with never-wearied love, 
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above. 

XLIII 
       He is a portion of the loveliness 
       Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear 
       His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress 
       Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there 
       All new successions to the forms they wear; 
       Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight 
       To its own likeness, as each mass may bear; 
       And bursting in its beauty and its might 
From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light. 

XLIV 
       The splendours of the firmament of time 
       May be eclips'd, but are extinguish'd not; 
       Like stars to their appointed height they climb, 
       And death is a low mist which cannot blot 
       The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought 
       Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair, 
       And love and life contend in it for what 
       Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there 
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air. 

XLV 
       The inheritors of unfulfill'd renown 
       Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought, 
       Far in the Unapparent. Chatterton 
       Rose pale, his solemn agony had not 
       Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought 
       And as he fell and as he liv'd and lov'd 
       Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot, 
       Arose; and Lucan, by his death approv'd: 
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reprov'd. 

XLVI 
       And many more, whose names on Earth are dark, 
       But whose transmitted effluence cannot die 
       So long as fire outlives the parent spark, 
       Rose, rob'd in dazzling immortality. 
       "Thou art become as one of us," they cry, 
       "It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long 
       Swung blind in unascended majesty, 
       Silent alone amid a Heaven of Song. 
Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!" 

XLVII 
       Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth, 
       Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright. 
       Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth; 
       As from a centre, dart thy spirit's light 
       Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might 
       Satiate the void circumference: then shrink 
       Even to a point within our day and night; 
       And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink 
When hope has kindled hope, and lur'd thee to the brink. 

XLVIII 
       Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre, 
       Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought 
       That ages, empires and religions there 
       Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought; 
       For such as he can lend—they borrow not 
       Glory from those who made the world their prey; 
       And he is gather'd to the kings of thought 
       Who wag'd contention with their time's decay, 
And of the past are all that cannot pass away. 

XLIX 
       Go thou to Rome—at once the Paradise, 
       The grave, the city, and the wilderness; 
       And where its wrecks like shatter'd mountains rise, 
       And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress 
       The bones of Desolation's nakedness 
       Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead 
       Thy footsteps to a slope of green access 
       Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead 
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread; 

L 
       And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time 
       Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand; 
       And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime, 
       Pavilioning the dust of him who plann'd 
       This refuge for his memory, doth stand 
       Like flame transform'd to marble; and beneath, 
       A field is spread, on which a newer band 
       Have pitch'd in Heaven's smile their camp of death, 
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguish'd breath. 

LI 
       Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet 
       To have outgrown the sorrow which consign'd 
       Its charge to each; and if the seal is set, 
       Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind, 
       Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find 
       Thine own well full, if thou returnest home, 
       Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind 
       Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb. 
What Adonais is, why fear we to become? 

LII 
       The One remains, the many change and pass; 
       Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly; 
       Life, like a dome of many-colour'd glass, 
       Stains the white radiance of Eternity, 
       Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die, 
       If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek! 
       Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky, 
       Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak 
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak. 

LIII 
       Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart? 
       Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here 
       They have departed; thou shouldst now depart! 
       A light is pass'd from the revolving year, 
       And man, and woman; and what still is dear 
       Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither. 
       The soft sky smiles, the low wind whispers near: 
       'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither, 
No more let Life divide what Death can join together. 

LIV 
       That Light whose smile kindles the Universe, 
       That Beauty in which all things work and move, 
       That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse 
       Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love 
       Which through the web of being blindly wove 
       By man and beast and earth and air and sea, 
       Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of 
       The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me, 
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality. 

LV 
       The breath whose might I have invok'd in song 
       Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven, 
       Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng 
       Whose sails were never to the tempest given; 
       The massy earth and sphered skies are riven! 
       I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar; 
       Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven, 
       The soul of Adonais, like a star, 
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.

Nondum amabam, et amare amabam, quaerebam quid amarem, amans amare.—  Confess. St. August.
Earth, ocean, air, belovèd brotherhood! 
If our great Mother has imbued my soul 
With aught of natural piety to feel 
Your love, and recompense the boon with mine; 
If dewy morn, and odorous noon, and even, 
With sunset and its gorgeous ministers, 
And solemn midnight's tingling silentness; 
If autumn's hollow sighs in the sere wood, 
And winter robing with pure snow and crowns 
Of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs; 
If spring's voluptuous pantings when she breathes 
Her first sweet kisses, have been dear to me; 
If no bright bird, insect, or gentle beast 
I consciously have injured, but still loved 
And cherished these my kindred; then forgive 
This boast, belovèd brethren, and withdraw 
No portion of your wonted favour now! 

         Mother of this unfathomable world! 
Favour my solemn song, for I have loved 
Thee ever, and thee only; I have watched 
Thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, 
And my heart ever gazes on the depth 
Of thy deep mysteries. I have made my bed 
In charnels and on coffins, where black death 
Keeps record of the trophies won from thee, 
Hoping to still these obstinate questionings 
Of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost 
Thy messenger, to render up the tale 
Of what we are. In lone and silent hours, 
When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, 
Like an inspired and desperate alchymist 
Staking his very life on some dark hope, 
Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks 
With my most innocent love, until strange tears 
Uniting with those breathless kisses, made 
Such magic as compels the charmèd night 
To render up thy charge:...and, though ne'er yet 
Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary, 
Enough from incommunicable dream, 
And twilight phantasms, and deep noon-day thought, 
Has shone within me, that serenely now 
And moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre 
Suspended in the solitary dome 
Of some mysterious and deserted fane, 
I wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain 
May modulate with murmurs of the air, 
And motions of the forests and the sea, 
And voice of living beings, and woven hymns 
Of night and day, and the deep heart of man. 

         There was a Poet whose untimely tomb 
No human hands with pious reverence reared, 
But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds 
Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid 
Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:— 
A lovely youth,—no mourning maiden decked 
With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath, 
The lone couch of his everlasting sleep:— 
Gentle, and brave, and generous,—no lorn bard 
Breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh: 
He lived, he died, he sung, in solitude. 
Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes, 
And virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined 
And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes. 
The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn, 
And Silence, too enamoured of that voice, 
Locks its mute music in her rugged cell. 

         By solemn vision, and bright silver dream, 
His infancy was nurtured. Every sight 
And sound from the vast earth and ambient air, 
Sent to his heart its choicest impulses. 
The fountains of divine philosophy 
Fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great, 
Or good, or lovely, which the sacred past 
In truth or fable consecrates, he felt 
And knew. When early youth had past, he left 
His cold fireside and alienated home 
To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands. 
Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness 
Has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought 
With his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men, 
His rest and food. Nature's most secret steps 
He like her shadow has pursued, where'er 
The red volcano overcanopies 
Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice 
With burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes 
On black bare pointed islets ever beat 
With sluggish surge, or where the secret caves 
Rugged and dark, winding among the springs 
Of fire and poison, inaccessible 
To avarice or pride, their starry domes 
Of diamond and of gold expand above 
Numberless and immeasurable halls, 
Frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines 
Of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite. 
Nor had that scene of ampler majesty 
Than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven 
And the green earth lost in his heart its claims 
To love and wonder; he would linger long 
In lonesome vales, making the wild his home, 
Until the doves and squirrels would partake 
From his innocuous hand his bloodless food, 
Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks, 
And the wild antelope, that starts whene'er 
The dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend 
Her timid steps to gaze upon a form 
More graceful than her own. 

                                                His wandering step 
Obedient to high thoughts, has visited 
The awful ruins of the days of old: 
Athens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste 
Where stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers 
Of Babylon, the eternal pyramids, 
Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe'er of strange 
Sculptured on alabaster obelisk, 
Or jasper tomb, or mutilated sphynx, 
Dark Æthiopia in her desert hills 
Conceals. Among the ruined temples there, 
Stupendous columns, and wild images 
Of more than man, where marble daemons watch 
The Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men 
Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, 
He lingered, poring on memorials 
Of the world's youth, through the long burning day 
Gazed on those speechless shapes, nor, when the moon 
Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades 
Suspended he that task, but ever gazed 
And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind 
Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw 
The thrilling secrets of the birth of time. 

         Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food, 
Her daily portion, from her father's tent, 
And spread her matting for his couch, and stole 
From duties and repose to tend his steps:— 
Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe 
To speak her love:—and watched his nightly sleep, 
Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips 
Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath 
Of innocent dreams arose: then, when red morn 
Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home 
Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned. 

         The Poet wandering on, through Arabie 
And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, 
And o'er the aërial mountains which pour down 
Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, 
In joy and exultation held his way; 
Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within 
Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine 
Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, 
Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched 
His languid limbs. A vision on his sleep 
There came, a dream of hopes that never yet 
Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veilèd maid 
Sate near him, talking in low solemn tones. 
Her voice was like the voice of his own soul 
Heard in the calm of thought; its music long, 
Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held 
His inmost sense suspended in its web 
Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues. 
Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme, 
And lofty hopes of divine liberty, 
Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, 
Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood 
Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame 
A permeating fire: wild numbers then 
She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs 
Subdued by its own pathos: her fair hands 
Were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp 
Strange symphony, and in their branching veins 
The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale. 
The beating of her heart was heard to fill 
The pauses of her music, and her breath 
Tumultuously accorded with those fits 
Of intermitted song. Sudden she rose, 
As if her heart impatiently endured 
Its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned, 
And saw by the warm light of their own life 
Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil 
Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare, 
Her dark locks floating in the breath of night, 
Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips 
Outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly. 
His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess 
Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled 
His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet 
Her panting bosom:...she drew back a while, 
Then, yielding to the irresistible joy, 
With frantic gesture and short breathless cry 
Folded his frame in her dissolving arms. 
Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night 
Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep, 
Like a dark flood suspended in its course 
Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain. 

         Roused by the shock he started from his trance— 
The cold white light of morning, the blue moon 
Low in the west, the clear and garish hills, 
The distinct valley and the vacant woods, 
Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled 
The hues of heaven that canopied his bower 
Of yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep, 
The mystery and the majesty of Earth, 
The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes 
Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly 
As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven. 
The spirit of sweet human love has sent 
A vision to the sleep of him who spurned 
Her choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues 
Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade; 
He overleaps the bounds. Alas! Alas! 
Were limbs and breath and being intertwined 
Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, for ever lost, 
In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep, 
That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death 
Conduct to thy mysterious paradise, 
O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds, 
And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake, 
Lead only to a black and watery depth, 
While death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung, 
Where every shade which the foul grave exhales 
Hides its dead eye from the detested day, 
Conduct, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms? 
This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart, 
The insatiate hope which it awakened stung 
His brain even like despair. 

                                              While daylight held 
The sky, the Poet kept mute conference 
With his still soul. At night the passion came, 
Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream, 
And shook him from his rest, and led him forth 
Into the darkness.—As an eagle grasped 
In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast 
Burn with the poison, and precipitates 
Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, 
Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight 
O'er the wide aëry wilderness: thus driven 
By the bright shadow of that lovely dream, 
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, 
Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells, 
Startling with careless step the moonlight snake, 
He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight, 
Shedding the mockery of its vital hues 
Upon his cheek of death. He wandered on 
Till vast Aornos, seen from Petra's steep, 
Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud; 
Through Balk, and where the desolated tombs 
Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind 
Their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on, 
Day after day a weary waste of hours, 
Bearing within his life the brooding care 
That ever fed on its decaying flame. 
And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair 
Sered by the autumn of strange suffering 
Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand 
Hung like dead bone within its withered skin; 
Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone 
As in a furnace burning secretly 
From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers, 
Who ministered with human charity 
His human wants, beheld with wondering awe 
Their fleeting visitant. The mountaineer, 
Encountering on some dizzy precipice 
That spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of wind 
With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet 
Disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused 
In its career: the infant would conceal 
His troubled visage in his mother's robe 
In terror at the glare of those wild eyes, 
To remember their strange light in many a dream 
Of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught 
By nature, would interpret half the woe 
That wasted him, would call him with false names 
Brother, and friend, would press his pallid hand 
At parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path 
Of his departure from their father's door. 

         At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore 
He paused, a wide and melancholy waste 
Of putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged 
His steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there, 
Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds. 
It rose as he approached, and with strong wings 
Scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course 
High over the immeasurable main. 
His eyes pursued its flight.—"Thou hast a home, 
Beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home, 
Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck 
With thine, and welcome thy return with eyes 
Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy. 
And what am I that I should linger here, 
With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes, 
Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned 
To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers 
In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven 
That echoes not my thoughts?" A gloomy smile 
Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips. 
For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly 
Its precious charge, and silent death exposed, 
Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure, 
With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms. 

         Startled by his own thoughts he looked around. 
There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight 
Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind. 
A little shallop floating near the shore 
Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze. 
It had been long abandoned, for its sides 
Gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints 
Swayed with the undulations of the tide. 
A restless impulse urged him to embark 
And meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste; 
For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves 
The slimy caverns of the populous deep. 

         The day was fair and sunny: sea and sky 
Drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind 
Swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves. 
Following his eager soul, the wanderer 
Leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft 
On the bare mast, and took his lonely seat, 
And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea 
Like a torn cloud before the hurricane. 

         As one that in a silver vision floats 
Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds 
Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly 
Along the dark and ruffled waters fled 
The straining boat.—A whirlwind swept it on, 
With fierce gusts and precipitating force, 
Through the white ridges of the chafèd sea. 
The waves arose. Higher and higher still 
Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge 
Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp. 
Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war 
Of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast 
Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven 
With dark obliterating course, he sate: 
As if their genii were the ministers 
Appointed to conduct him to the light 
Of those belovèd eyes, the Poet sate 
Holding the steady helm. Evening came on, 
The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues 
High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray 
That canopied his path o'er the waste deep; 
Twilight, ascending slowly from the east, 
Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks 
O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day; 
Night followed, clad with stars. On every side 
More horribly the multitudinous streams 
Of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war 
Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock 
The calm and spangled sky. The little boat 
Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam 
Down the steep cataract of a wintry river; 
Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave; 
Now leaving far behind the bursting mass 
That fell, convulsing ocean. Safely fled— 
As if that frail and wasted human form, 
Had been an elemental god. 

                                              At midnight 
The moon arose: and lo! the ethereal cliffs 
Of Caucasus, whose icy summits shone 
Among the stars like sunlight, and around 
Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves 
Bursting and eddying irresistibly 
Rage and resound for ever.—Who shall save?— 
The boat fled on,—the boiling torrent drove,— 
The crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms, 
The shattered mountain overhung the sea, 
And faster still, beyond all human speed, 
Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave, 
The little boat was driven. A cavern there 
Yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths 
Ingulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on 
With unrelaxing speed.—"Vision and Love!" 
The Poet cried aloud, "I have beheld 
The path of thy departure. Sleep and death 
Shall not divide us long!" 

                                              The boat pursued 
The windings of the cavern. Daylight shone 
At length upon that gloomy river's flow; 
Now, where the fiercest war among the waves 
Is calm, on the unfathomable stream 
The boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven, 
Exposed those black depths to the azure sky, 
Ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell 
Even to the base of Caucasus, with sound 
That shook the everlasting rocks, the mass 
Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm; 
Stair above stair the eddying waters rose, 
Circling immeasurably fast, and laved 
With alternating dash the gnarlèd roots 
Of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms 
In darkness over it. I' the midst was left, 
Reflecting, yet distorting every cloud, 
A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm. 
Seized by the sway of the ascending stream, 
With dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round, 
Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose, 
Till on the verge of the extremest curve, 
Where, through an opening of the rocky bank, 
The waters overflow, and a smooth spot 
Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides 
Is left, the boat paused shuddering.—Shall it sink 
Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress 
Of that resistless gulf embosom it? 
Now shall it fall?—A wandering stream of wind, 
Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail, 
And, lo! with gentle motion, between banks 
Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream, 
Beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark! 
The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar, 
With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods. 
Where the embowering trees recede, and leave 
A little space of green expanse, the cove 
Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers 
For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes, 
Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave 
Of the boat's motion marred their pensive task, 
Which nought but vagrant bird, or wanton wind, 
Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay 
Had e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed 
To deck with their bright hues his withered hair, 
But on his heart its solitude returned, 
And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid 
In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame 
Had yet performed its ministry: it hung 
Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud 
Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods 
Of night close over it. 

                                              The noonday sun 
Now shone upon the forest, one vast mass 
Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence 
A narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves 
Scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks 
Mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever. 
The meeting boughs and implicated leaves 
Wove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as led 
By love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death, 
He sought in Nature's dearest haunt, some bank 
Her cradle, and his sepulchre. More dark 
And dark the shades accumulate. The oak, 
Expanding its immense and knotty arms, 
Embraces the light beech. The pyramids 
Of the tall cedar overarching, frame 
Most solemn domes within, and far below, 
Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky, 
The ash and the acacia floating hang 
Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed 
In rainbow and in fire, the parasites, 
Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around 
The grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes, 
With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles, 
Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love, 
These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs 
Uniting their close union; the woven leaves 
Make net-work of the dark blue light of day, 
And the night's noontide clearness, mutable 
As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns 
Beneath these canopies extend their swells, 
Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms 
Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen 
Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine, 
A soul-dissolving odour, to invite 
To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell, 
Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep 
Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades, 
Like vaporous shapes half seen; beyond, a well, 
Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave, 
Images all the woven boughs above, 
And each depending leaf, and every speck 
Of azure sky, darting between their chasms; 
Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves 
Its portraiture, but some inconstant star 
Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair, 
Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon, 
Or gorgeous insect floating motionless, 
Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings 
Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon. 

         Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld 
Their own wan light through the reflected lines 
Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth 
Of that still fountain; as the human heart, 
Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave, 
Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard 
The motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung 
Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel 
An unaccustomed presence, and the sound 
Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs 
Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed 
To stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes 
Of shadowy silver or enshrining light, 
Borrowed from aught the visible world affords 
Of grace, or majesty, or mystery;— 
But, undulating woods, and silent well, 
And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom 
Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming, 
Held commune with him, as if he and it 
Were all that was,—only... when his regard 
Was raised by intense pensiveness,... two eyes, 
Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought, 
And seemed with their serene and azure smiles 
To beckon him. 

                                              Obedient to the light 
That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing 
The windings of the dell.—The rivulet 
Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine 
Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell 
Among the moss, with hollow harmony 
Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones 
It danced; like childhood laughing as it went: 
Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept, 
Reflecting every herb and drooping bud 
That overhung its quietness.—"O stream! 
Whose source is inaccessibly profound, 
Whither do thy mysterious waters tend? 
Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness, 
Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs, 
Thy searchless fountain, and invisible course 
Have each their type in me: and the wide sky, 
And measureless ocean may declare as soon 
What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud 
Contains thy waters, as the universe 
Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched 
Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste 
I' the passing wind!" 

                                              Beside the grassy shore 
Of the small stream he went; he did impress 
On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught 
Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one 
Roused by some joyous madness from the couch 
Of fever, he did move; yet, not like him, 
Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame 
Of his frail exultation shall be spent, 
He must descend. With rapid steps he went 
Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow 
Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now 
The forest's solemn canopies were changed 
For the uniform and lightsome evening sky. 
Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed 
The struggling brook: tall spires of windlestrae 
Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope, 
And nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines 
Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots 
The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here, 
Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away, 
The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin 
And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes 
Had shone, gleam stony orbs:—so from his steps 
Bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade 
Of the green groves, with all their odorous winds 
And musical motions. Calm, he still pursued 
The stream, that with a larger volume now 
Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there 
Fretted a path through its descending curves 
With its wintry speed. On every side now rose 
Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms, 
Lifted their black and barren pinnacles 
In the light of evening, and its precipice 
Obscuring the ravine, disclosed above, 
Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves, 
Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues 
To the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands 
Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks, 
And seems, with its accumulated crags, 
To overhang the world: for wide expand 
Beneath the wan stars and descending moon 
Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams, 
Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom 
Of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills 
Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge 
Of the remote horizon. The near scene, 
In naked and severe simplicity, 
Made contrast with the universe. A pine, 
Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy 
Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast 
Yielding one only response, at each pause, 
In most familiar cadence, with the howl 
The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams 
Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river, 
Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path, 
Fell into that immeasurable void, 
Scattering its waters to the passing winds. 

         Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine 
And torrent, were not all;—one silent nook 
Was there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain, 
Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks, 
It overlooked in its serenity 
The dark earth, and the bending vault of stars. 
It was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile 
Even in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped 
The fissured stones with its entwining arms, 
And did embower with leaves for ever green, 
And berries dark, the smooth and even space 
Of its inviolated floor, and here 
The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore, 
In wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay, 
Red, yellow, or ethereally pale, 
Rivals the pride of summer. 'Tis the haunt 
Of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach 
The wilds to love tranquillity. One step, 
One human step alone, has ever broken 
The stillness of its solitude:—one voice 
Alone inspired its echoes;—even that voice 
Which hither came, floating among the winds, 
And led the loveliest among human forms 
To make their wild haunts the depository 
Of all the grace and beauty that endued 
Its motions, render up its majesty, 
Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm, 
And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould, 
Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss, 
Commit the colours of that varying cheek, 
That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes. 

         The dim and hornèd moon hung low, and poured 
A sea of lustre on the horizon's verge 
That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist 
Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank 
Wan moonlight even to fulness: not a star 
Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds, 
Danger's grim playmates, on that precipice 
Slept, clasped in his embrace.—O, storm of death! 
Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night: 
And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still 
Guiding its irresistible career 
In thy devastating omnipotence, 
Art king of this frail world, from the red field 
Of slaughter, from the reeking hospital, 
The patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed 
Of innocence, the scaffold and the throne, 
A mighty voice invokes thee. Ruin calls 
His brother Death. A rare and regal prey 
He hath prepared, prowling around the world; 
Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men 
Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms, 
Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine 
The unheeded tribute of a broken heart. 

         When on the threshold of the green recess 
The wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death 
Was on him. Yet a little, ere it fled, 
Did he resign his high and holy soul 
To images of the majestic past, 
That paused within his passive being now, 
Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe 
Through some dim latticed chamber. He did place 
His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk 
Of the old pine. Upon an ivied stone 
Reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest, 
Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink 
Of that obscurest chasm;—and thus he lay, 
Surrendering to their final impulses 
The hovering powers of life. Hope and despair, 
The torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear 
Marred his repose, the influxes of sense, 
And his own being unalloyed by pain, 
Yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed 
The stream of thought, till he lay breathing there 
At peace, and faintly smiling:—his last sight 
Was the great moon, which o'er the western line 
Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended, 
With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed 
To mingle. Now upon the jaggèd hills 
It rests, and still as the divided frame 
Of the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood, 
That ever beat in mystic sympathy 
With nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still: 
And when two lessening points of light alone 
Gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp 
Of his faint respiration scarce did stir 
The stagnate night:—till the minutest ray 
Was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart. 
It paused—it fluttered. But when heaven remained 
Utterly black, the murky shades involved 
An image, silent, cold, and motionless, 
As their own voiceless earth and vacant air. 
Even as a vapour fed with golden beams 
That ministered on sunlight, ere the west 
Eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame— 
No sense, no motion, no divinity— 
A fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings 
The breath of heaven did wander—a bright stream 
Once fed with many-voicèd waves—a dream 
Of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever, 
Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now. 

         O, for Medea's wondrous alchemy, 
Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam 
With bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale 
From vernal blooms fresh fragrance! O, that God, 
Profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice 
Which but one living man has drained, who now, 
Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels 
No proud exemption in the blighting curse 
He bears, over the world wanders for ever, 
Lone as incarnate death! O, that the dream 
Of dark magician in his visioned cave, 
Raking the cinders of a crucible 
For life and power, even when his feeble hand 
Shakes in its last decay, were the true law 
Of this so lovely world! But thou art fled 
Like some frail exhalation; which the dawn 
Robes in its golden beams,—ah! thou hast fled! 
The brave, the gentle, and the beautiful, 
The child of grace and genius. Heartless things 
Are done and said i' the world, and many worms 
And beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth 
From sea and mountain, city and wilderness, 
In vesper low or joyous orison, 
Lifts still its solemn voice:—but thou art fled— 
Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes 
Of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee 
Been purest ministers, who are, alas! 
Now thou art not. Upon those pallid lips 
So sweet even in their silence, on those eyes 
That image sleep in death, upon that form 
Yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear 
Be shed—not even in thought. Nor, when those hues 
Are gone, and those divinest lineaments, 
Worn by the senseless wind, shall live alone 
In the frail pauses of this simple strain, 
Let not high verse, mourning the memory 
Of that which is no more, or painting's woe 
Or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery 
Their own cold powers. Art and eloquence, 
And all the shows o' the world are frail and vain 
To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade. 
It is a woe too "deep for tears," when all 
Is reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit, 
Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves 
Those who remain behind, not sobs or groans, 
The passionate tumult of a clinging hope; 
But pale despair and cold tranquillity, 
Nature's vast frame, the web of human things, 
Birth and the grave, that are not as they were.

Heigho! the lark and the owl!
         One flies the morning, and one lulls the night:
Only the nightingale, poor fond soul,
         Sings like the fool through darkness and light.

                "A widow bird sate mourning for her love
                        Upon a wintry bough;
                The frozen wind crept on above,
                        The freezing stream below.

                "There was no leaf upon the forest bare,
                        No flower upon the ground,
                And little motion in the air
                        Except the mill-wheel's sound."
#END#
Art thou pale for weariness
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
         Wandering companionless
Among the stars that have a different birth,
And ever changing, like a joyless eye
That finds no object worth its constancy?
#END#
An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King; 
Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow 
Through public scorn,—mud from a muddy spring; 
Rulers who neither see nor feel nor know, 
But leechlike to their fainting country cling 
Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow. 
A people starved and stabbed in th' untilled field; 
An army, whom liberticide and prey 
Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield; 
Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay; 
Religion Christless, Godless—a book sealed; 
A senate, Time’s worst statute, unrepealed— 
Are graves from which a glorious Phantom may 
Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day.
#END#
Emily, 
A ship is floating in the harbour now, 
A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow; 
There is a path on the sea's azure floor, 
No keel has ever plough'd that path before; 
The halcyons brood around the foamless isles; 
The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles; 
The merry mariners are bold and free: 
Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me? 
Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest 
Is a far Eden of the purple East; 
And we between her wings will sit, while Night, 
And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight, 
Our ministers, along the boundless Sea, 
Treading each other's heels, unheededly. 
It is an isle under Ionian skies, 
Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise, 
And, for the harbours are not safe and good, 
This land would have remain'd a solitude 
But for some pastoral people native there, 
Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air 
Draw the last spirit of the age of gold, 
Simple and spirited; innocent and bold. 
The blue Aegean girds this chosen home, 
With ever-changing sound and light and foam, 
Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar; 
And all the winds wandering along the shore 
Undulate with the undulating tide: 
There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide; 
And many a fountain, rivulet and pond, 
As clear as elemental diamond, 
Or serene morning air; and far beyond, 
The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer 
(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year) 
Pierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls 
Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls 
Illumining, with sound that never fails 
Accompany the noonday nightingales; 
And all the place is peopled with sweet airs; 
The light clear element which the isle wears 
Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers, 
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers, 
And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep; 
And from the moss violets and jonquils peep 
And dart their arrowy odour through the brain 
Till you might faint with that delicious pain. 
And every motion, odour, beam and tone, 
With that deep music is in unison: 
Which is a soul within the soul—they seem 
Like echoes of an antenatal dream. 
It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth and Sea, 
Cradled and hung in clear tranquillity; 
Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer, 
Wash'd by the soft blue Oceans of young air. 
It is a favour'd place. Famine or Blight, 
Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light 
Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they 
Sail onward far upon their fatal way: 
The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm 
To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm 
Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew, 
From which its fields and woods ever renew 
Their green and golden immortality. 
And from the sea there rise, and from the sky 
There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright, 
Veil after veil, each hiding some delight, 
Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside, 
Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride 
Glowing at once with love and loveliness, 
Blushes and trembles at its own excess: 
Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less 
Burns in the heart of this delicious isle, 
An atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile 
Unfolds itself, and may be felt not seen 
O'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green, 
Filling their bare and void interstices. 
But the chief marvel of the wilderness 
Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how 
None of the rustic island-people know: 
'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height 
It overtops the woods; but, for delight, 
Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime 
Had been invented, in the world's young prime, 
Rear'd it, a wonder of that simple time, 
An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house 
Made sacred to his sister and his spouse. 
It scarce seems now a wreck of human art, 
But, as it were, Titanic; in the heart 
Of Earth having assum'd its form, then grown 
Out of the mountains, from the living stone, 
Lifting itself in caverns light and high: 
For all the antique and learned imagery 
Has been eras'd, and in the place of it 
The ivy and the wild-vine interknit 
The volumes of their many-twining stems; 
Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems 
The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky 
Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery 
With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen, 
Or fragments of the day's intense serene; 
Working mosaic on their Parian floors. 
And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers 
And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem 
To sleep in one another's arms, and dream 
Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we 
Read in their smiles, and call reality. 

       This isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd 
Thee to be lady of the solitude. 
And I have fitted up some chambers there 
Looking towards the golden Eastern air, 
And level with the living winds, which flow 
Like waves above the living waves below. 
I have sent books and music there, and all 
Those instruments with which high Spirits call 
The future from its cradle, and the past 
Out of its grave, and make the present last 
In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, 
Folded within their own eternity. 
Our simple life wants little, and true taste 
Hires not the pale drudge Luxury to waste 
The scene it would adorn, and therefore still, 
Nature with all her children haunts the hill. 
The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet 
Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit 
Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance 
Between the quick bats in their twilight dance; 
The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight 
Before our gate, and the slow, silent night 
Is measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep. 
Be this our home in life, and when years heap 
Their wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay, 
Let us become the overhanging day, 
The living soul of this Elysian isle, 
Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile 
We two will rise, and sit, and walk together, 
Under the roof of blue Ionian weather, 
And wander in the meadows, or ascend 
The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend 
With lightest winds, to touch their paramour; 
Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore, 
Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea, 
Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— 
Possessing and possess'd by all that is 
Within that calm circumference of bliss, 
And by each other, till to love and live 
Be one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive 
Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep 
The moonlight of the expir'd night asleep, 
Through which the awaken'd day can never peep; 
A veil for our seclusion, close as night's, 
Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights; 
Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain 
Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again. 
And we will talk, until thought's melody 
Become too sweet for utterance, and it die 
In words, to live again in looks, which dart 
With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart, 
Harmonizing silence without a sound. 
Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound, 
And our veins beat together; and our lips 
With other eloquence than words, eclipse 
The soul that burns between them, and the wells 
Which boil under our being's inmost cells, 
The fountains of our deepest life, shall be 
Confus'd in Passion's golden purity, 
As mountain-springs under the morning sun. 
We shall become the same, we shall be one 
Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two? 
One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew, 
Till like two meteors of expanding flame, 
Those spheres instinct with it become the same, 
Touch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still 
Burning, yet ever inconsumable: 
In one another's substance finding food, 
Like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd 
To nourish their bright lives with baser prey, 
Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away: 
One hope within two wills, one will beneath 
Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death, 
One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality, 
And one annihilation. Woe is me! 
The winged words on which my soul would pierce 
Into the height of Love's rare Universe, 
Are chains of lead around its flight of fire— 
I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!
#END#
CHORUS 
The world's great age begins anew, 
         The golden years return, 
The earth doth like a snake renew 
         Her winter weeds outworn: 
Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam 
Like wrecks of a dissolving dream. 

A brighter Hellas rears its mountains 
         From waves serener far; 
A new Peneus rolls his fountains 
      Against the morning star. 
Where fairer Tempes bloom, there sleep 
Young Cyclads on a sunnier deep. 

A loftier Argo cleaves the main, 
         Fraught with a later prize; 
Another Orpheus sings again, 
         And loves, and weeps, and dies. 
A new Ulysses leaves once more 
Calypso for his native shore. 

Oh, write no more the tale of Troy, 
         If earth Death's scroll must be! 
Nor mix with Laian rage the joy 
         Which dawns upon the free: 
Although a subtler Sphinx renew 
Riddles of death Thebes never knew. 

Another Athens shall arise, 
         And to remoter time 
Bequeath, like sunset to the skies, 
         The splendour of its prime; 
And leave, if nought so bright may live, 
All earth can take or Heaven can give. 

Saturn and Love their long repose 
         Shall burst, more bright and good 
Than all who fell, than One who rose, 
         Than many unsubdu'd: 
Not gold, not blood, their altar dowers, 
But votive tears and symbol flowers. 

Oh cease! must hate and death return? 
         Cease! must men kill and die? 
Cease! drain not to its dregs the urn 
         Of bitter prophecy. 
The world is weary of the past, 
Oh might it die or rest at last!
#END#
From the forests and highlands 
         We come, we come; 
From the river-girt islands, 
         Where loud waves are dumb 
                Listening to my sweet pipings. 
The wind in the reeds and the rushes, 
         The bees on the bells of thyme, 
The birds on the myrtle bushes, 
         The cicale above in the lime, 
And the lizards below in the grass, 
Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was, 
                Listening to my sweet pipings. 

Liquid Peneus was flowing, 
         And all dark Tempe lay 
In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing 
         The light of the dying day, 
                Speeded by my sweet pipings. 
The Sileni, and Sylvans, and Fauns, 
         And the Nymphs of the woods and the waves, 
To the edge of the moist river-lawns, 
         And the brink of the dewy caves, 
And all that did then attend and follow, 
Were silent with love, as you now, Apollo, 
                With envy of my sweet pipings. 

I sang of the dancing stars, 
         I sang of the daedal Earth, 
And of Heaven, and the giant wars, 
         And Love, and Death, and Birth— 
                And then I chang'd my pipings, 
Singing how down the vale of Maenalus 
         I pursu'd a maiden and clasp'd a reed. 
Gods and men, we are all deluded thus! 
         It breaks in our bosom and then we bleed. 
All wept, as I think both ye now would, 
If envy or age had not frozen your blood, 
                At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.
#END#
The awful shadow of some unseen Power 
         Floats though unseen among us; visiting 
         This various world with as inconstant wing 
As summer winds that creep from flower to flower; 
Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower, 
                It visits with inconstant glance 
                Each human heart and countenance; 
Like hues and harmonies of evening, 
                Like clouds in starlight widely spread, 
                Like memory of music fled, 
                Like aught that for its grace may be 
Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery. 

Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost consecrate 
         With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon 
         Of human thought or form, where art thou gone? 
Why dost thou pass away and leave our state, 
This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate? 
                Ask why the sunlight not for ever 
                Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river, 
Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown, 
                Why fear and dream and death and birth 
                Cast on the daylight of this earth 
                Such gloom, why man has such a scope 
For love and hate, despondency and hope? 

No voice from some sublimer world hath ever 
         To sage or poet these responses given: 
         Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven, 
Remain the records of their vain endeavour: 
Frail spells whose utter'd charm might not avail to sever, 
                From all we hear and all we see, 
                Doubt, chance and mutability. 
Thy light alone like mist o'er mountains driven, 
                Or music by the night-wind sent 
                Through strings of some still instrument, 
                Or moonlight on a midnight stream, 
Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream. 

Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart 
         And come, for some uncertain moments lent. 
         Man were immortal and omnipotent, 
Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art, 
Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart. 
                Thou messenger of sympathies, 
                That wax and wane in lovers' eyes; 
Thou, that to human thought art nourishment, 
                Like darkness to a dying flame! 
                Depart not as thy shadow came, 
                Depart not—lest the grave should be, 
Like life and fear, a dark reality. 

While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped 
         Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin, 
         And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing 
Hopes of high talk with the departed dead. 
I call'd on poisonous names with which our youth is fed; 
                I was not heard; I saw them not; 
                When musing deeply on the lot 
Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing 
                All vital things that wake to bring 
                News of birds and blossoming, 
                Sudden, thy shadow fell on me; 
   I shriek'd, and clasp'd my hands in ecstasy! 

I vow'd that I would dedicate my powers 
         To thee and thine: have I not kept the vow? 
         With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now 
I call the phantoms of a thousand hours 
Each from his voiceless grave: they have in vision'd bowers 
                Of studious zeal or love's delight 
                Outwatch'd with me the envious night: 
They know that never joy illum'd my brow 
                Unlink'd with hope that thou wouldst free 
                This world from its dark slavery, 
                That thou, O awful LOVELINESS, 
Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express. 

The day becomes more solemn and serene 
         When noon is past; there is a harmony 
         In autumn, and a lustre in its sky, 
Which through the summer is not heard or seen, 
As if it could not be, as if it had not been! 
                Thus let thy power, which like the truth 
                Of nature on my passive youth 
Descended, to my onward life supply 
                Its calm, to one who worships thee, 
                And every form containing thee, 
                Whom, SPIRIT fair, thy spells did bind 
To fear himself, and love all human kind.

(excerpt)
I rode one evening with Count Maddalo
Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow
Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand
Of hillocks, heap'd from ever-shifting sand,
Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,
Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,
Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,
Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,
Abandons; and no other object breaks
The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes
Broken and unrepair'd, and the tide makes
A narrow space of level sand thereon,
Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.
This ride was my delight. I love all waste
And solitary places; where we taste
The pleasure of believing what we see
Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:
And such was this wide ocean, and this shore
More barren than its billows; and yet more
Than all, with a remember'd friend I love
To ride as then I rode; for the winds drove
The living spray along the sunny air
Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,
Stripp'd to their depths by the awakening north;
And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth
Harmonizing with solitude, and sent
Into our hearts aëreal merriment.
So, as we rode, we talk'd; and the swift thought,
Winging itself with laughter, linger'd not,
But flew from brain to brainsuch glee was ours,
Charg'd with light memories of remember'd hours,
None slow enough for sadness: till we came
Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.
This day had been cheerful but cold, and now
The sun was sinking, and the wind also.
Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be
Talk interrupted with such raillery
As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn
The thoughts it would extinguish: 'twas forlorn,
Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,
The devils held within the dales of Hell
Concerning God, freewill and destiny:
Of all that earth has been or yet may be,
All that vain men imagine or believe,
Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,
We descanted, and I (for ever still
Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)
Argu'd against despondency, but pride
Made my companion take the darker side.
The sense that he was greater than his kind
Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind
By gazing on its own exceeding light.
Meanwhile the sun paus'd ere it should alight,
Over the horizon of the mountainsOh,
How beautiful is sunset, when the glow
Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,
Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!
Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towers
Of cities they encircle! It was ours
To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,
Just where we had dismounted, the Count's men
Were waiting for us with the gondola.
As those who pause on some delightful way
Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood
Looking upon the evening, and the flood
Which lay between the city and the shore,
Pav'd with the image of the sky.... The hoar
And aëry Alps towards the North appear'd
Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark rear'd
Between the East and West; and half the sky
Was roof'd with clouds of rich emblazonry
Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew
Down the steep West into a wondrous hue
Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent
Where the swift sun yet paus'd in his descent
Among the many-folded hills: they were
Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,
As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,
The likeness of a clump of peakèd isles
And thenas if the Earth and Sea had been
Dissolv'd into one lake of fire, were seen
Those mountains towering as from waves of flame
Around the vaporous sun, from which there came
The inmost purple spirit of light, and made
Their very peaks transparent. "Ere it fade,"
Said my companion, "I will show you soon
A better station"so, o'er the lagune
We glided; and from that funereal bark
I lean'd, and saw the city, and could mark
How from their many isles, in evening's gleam,
Its temples and its palaces did seem
Like fabrics of enchantment pil'd to Heaven.
I was about to speak, when"We are even
Now at the point I meant," said Maddalo,
And bade the gondolieri cease to row.
"Look, Julian, on the west, and listen well
If you hear not a deep and heavy bell."
I look'd, and saw between us and the sun
A building on an island; such a one
As age to age might add, for uses vile,
A windowless, deform'd and dreary pile;
And on the top an open tower, where hung
A bell, which in the radiance sway'd and swung;
We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:
The broad sun sunk behind it, and it toll'd
In strong and black relief. "What we behold
Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,"
Said Maddalo, "and ever at this hour
Those who may cross the water, hear that bell
Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,
To vespers." "As much skill as need to pray
In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they
To their stern Maker," I replied. "O ho!
You talk as in years past," said Maddalo.
" 'Tis strange men change not. You were ever still
Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel,
A wolf for the meek lambsif you can't swim
Beware of Providence." I look'd on him,
But the gay smile had faded in his eye.
"And such," he cried, "is our mortality,
And this must be the emblem and the sign
Of what should be eternal and divine!
And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,
Hung in a heaven-illumin'd tower, must toll
Our thoughts and our desires to meet below
Round the rent heart and prayas madmen do
For what? they know nottill the night of death,
As sunset that strange vision, severeth
Our memory from itself, and us from all
We sought and yet were baffled." I recall
The sense of what he said, although I mar
The force of his expressions. The broad star
Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,
And the black bell became invisible,
And the red tower look'd gray, and all between
The churches, ships and palaces were seen
Huddled in gloom;into the purple sea
The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.
We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola
Convey'd me to my lodgings by the way.

       The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:
Ere Maddalo arose, I call'd on him,
And whilst I waited with his child I play'd;
A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,
A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,
Graceful without design and unforeseeing,
With eyesOh speak not of her eyes!which seem
Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam
With such deep meaning, as we never see
But in the human countenance: with me
She was a special favourite: I had nurs'd
Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first
To this bleak world; and she yet seem'd to know
On second sight her ancient playfellow,
Less chang'd than she was by six months or so;
For after her first shyness was worn out
We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,
When the Count enter'd. Salutations past
"The word you spoke last night might well have cast
A darkness on my spiritif man be
The passive thing you say, I should not see
Much harm in the religions and old saws
(Though I may never own such leaden laws)
Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:
Mine is another faith"thus much I spoke
And noting he replied not, added: "See
This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;
She spends a happy time with little care,
While we to such sick thoughts subjected are
As came on you last night. It is our will
That thus enchains us to permitted ill.
We might be otherwise. We might be all
We dream of happy, high, majestical.
Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek
But in our mind? and if we were not weak
Should we be less in deed than in desire?"
"Ay, if we were not weakand we aspire
How vainly to be strong!" said Maddalo:
"You talk Utopia." "It remains to know,"
I then rejoin'd, "and those who try may find
How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;
Brittle perchance as straw.... We are assur'd
Much may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd,
Of what degrades and crushes us. We know
That we have power over ourselves to do
And sufferwhat, we know not till we try;
But something nobler than to live and die:
So taught those kings of old philosophy
Who reign'd, before Religion made men blind;
And those who suffer with their suffering kind
Yet feel their faith, religion." "My dear friend,"
Said Maddalo, "my judgement will not bend
To your opinion, though I think you might
Make such a system refutation-tight
As far as words go. I knew one like you
Who to this city came some months ago,
With whom I argu'd in this sort, and he
Is now gone madand so he answer'd me
Poor fellow! but if you would like to go
We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show
How vain are such aspiring theories."
"I hope to prove the induction otherwise,
And that a want of that true theory, still,
Which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things ill
Or in himself or others, has thus bow'd
His being. There are some by nature proud,
Who patient in all else demand but this
To love and be belov'd with gentleness;
And being scorn'd, what wonder if they die
Some living death? this is not destiny
But man's own wilful ill."

                                                               As thus I spoke
Servants announc'd the gondola, and we
Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
Sail'd to the island where the madhouse stands.
#END#
Many a green isle needs must be 
In the deep wide sea of Misery, 
Or the mariner, worn and wan, 
Never thus could voyage on 
Day and night, and night and day, 
Drifting on his dreary way, 
With the solid darkness black 
Closing round his vessel's track; 
Whilst above, the sunless sky, 
Big with clouds, hangs heavily, 
And behind, the tempest fleet 
Hurries on with lightning feet, 
Riving sail, and cord, and plank, 
Till the ship has almost drank 
Death from the o'er-brimming deep; 
And sinks down, down, like that sleep 
When the dreamer seems to be 
Weltering through eternity; 
And the dim low line before 
Of a dark and distant shore 
Still recedes, as ever still 
Longing with divided will, 
But no power to seek or shun, 
He is ever drifted on 
O'er the unreposing wave 
To the haven of the grave. 
What, if there no friends will greet; 
What, if there no heart will meet 
His with love's impatient beat; 
Wander wheresoe'er he may, 
Can he dream before that day 
To find refuge from distress 
In friendship's smile, in love's caress? 
Then 'twill wreak him little woe 
Whether such there be or no: 
Senseless is the breast and cold 
Which relenting love would fold; 
Bloodless are the veins and chill 
Which the pulse of pain did fill; 
Every little living nerve 
That from bitter words did swerve 
Round the tortur'd lips and brow, 
Are like sapless leaflets now 
Frozen upon December's bough. 

On the beach of a northern sea 
Which tempests shake eternally, 
As once the wretch there lay to sleep, 
Lies a solitary heap, 
One white skull and seven dry bones, 
On the margin of the stones, 
Where a few gray rushes stand, 
Boundaries of the sea and land: 
Nor is heard one voice of wail 
But the sea-mews, as they sail 
O'er the billows of the gale; 
Or the whirlwind up and down 
Howling, like a slaughter'd town, 
When a king in glory rides 
Through the pomp of fratricides: 
Those unburied bones around 
There is many a mournful sound; 
There is no lament for him, 
Like a sunless vapour, dim, 
Who once cloth'd with life and thought 
What now moves nor murmurs not. 

Ay, many flowering islands lie 
In the waters of wide Agony: 
To such a one this morn was led 
My bark, by soft winds piloted: 
'Mid the mountains Euganean 
I stood listening to the paean 
With which the legion'd rooks did hail 
The sun's uprise majestical; 
Gathering round with wings all hoar, 
Through the dewy mist they soar 
Like gray shades, till the eastern heaven 
Bursts, and then, as clouds of even, 
Fleck'd with fire and azure, lie 
In the unfathomable sky, 
So their plumes of purple grain, 
Starr'd with drops of golden rain, 
Gleam above the sunlight woods, 
As in silent multitudes 
On the morning's fitful gale 
Through the broken mist they sail, 
And the vapours cloven and gleaming 
Follow, down the dark steep streaming, 
Till all is bright, and clear, and still, 
Round the solitary hill. 

Beneath is spread like a green sea 
The waveless plain of Lombardy, 
Bounded by the vaporous air, 
Islanded by cities fair; 
Underneath Day's azure eyes 
Ocean's nursling, Venice lies, 
A peopled labyrinth of walls, 
Amphitrite's destin'd halls, 
Which her hoary sire now paves 
With his blue and beaming waves. 
Lo! the sun upsprings behind, 
Broad, red, radiant, half-reclin'd 
On the level quivering line 
Of the water crystalline; 
And before that chasm of light, 
As within a furnace bright, 
Column, tower, and dome, and spire, 
Shine like obelisks of fire, 
Pointing with inconstant motion 
From the altar of dark ocean 
To the sapphire-tinted skies; 
As the flames of sacrifice 
From the marble shrines did rise, 
As to pierce the dome of gold 
Where Apollo spoke of old. 

Sun-girt City, thou hast been 
Ocean's child, and then his queen; 
Now is come a darker day, 
And thou soon must be his prey, 
If the power that rais'd thee here 
Hallow so thy watery bier. 
A less drear ruin then than now, 
With thy conquest-branded brow 
Stooping to the slave of slaves 
From thy throne, among the waves 
Wilt thou be, when the sea-mew 
Flies, as once before it flew, 
O'er thine isles depopulate, 
And all is in its ancient state, 
Save where many a palace gate 
With green sea-flowers overgrown 
Like a rock of Ocean's own, 
Topples o'er the abandon'd sea 
As the tides change sullenly. 
The fisher on his watery way, 
Wandering at the close of day, 
Will spread his sail and seize his oar 
Till he pass the gloomy shore, 
Lest thy dead should, from their sleep 
Bursting o'er the starlight deep, 
Lead a rapid masque of death 
O'er the waters of his path. 
Those who alone thy towers behold 
Quivering through a{:e}real gold, 
As I now behold them here, 
Would imagine not they were 
Sepulchres, where human forms, 
Like pollution-nourish'd worms, 
To the corpse of greatness cling, 
Murder'd, and now mouldering: 
But if Freedom should awake 
In her omnipotence, and shake 
From the Celtic Anarch's hold 
All the keys of dungeons cold, 
Where a hundred cities lie 
Chain'd like thee, ingloriously, 
Thou and all thy sister band 
Might adorn this sunny land, 
Twining memories of old time 
With new virtues more sublime; 
If not, perish thou and they, 
Clouds which stain truth's rising day 
By her sun consum'd away— 
Earth can spare ye! while like flowers, 
In the waste of years and hours, 
From your dust new nations spring 
With more kindly blossoming. 

Perish—let there only be 
Floating o'er thy hearthless sea 
As the garment of thy sky 
Clothes the world immortally, 
One remembrance, more sublime 
Than the tatter'd pall of time, 
Which scarce hides thy visage wan: 
That a tempest-cleaving Swan 
Of the sons of Albion, 
Driven from his ancestral streams 
By the might of evil dreams, 
Found a nest in thee; and Ocean 
Welcom'd him with such emotion 
That its joy grew his, and sprung 
From his lips like music flung 
O'er a mighty thunder-fit, 
Chastening terror: what though yet 
Poesy's unfailing river, 
Which through Albion winds forever 
Lashing with melodious wave 
Many a sacred Poet's grave, 
Mourn its latest nursling fled! 
What though thou with all thy dead 
Scarce can for this fame repay 
Aught thine own, oh, rather say 
Though thy sins and slaveries foul 
Overcloud a sunlike soul! 
As the ghost of Homer clings 
Round Scamander's wasting springs; 
As divinest Shakespeare's might 
Fills Avon and the world with light 
Like omniscient power which he 
Imag'd 'mid mortality; 
As the love from Petrarch's urn 
Yet amid yon hills doth burn, 
A quenchless lamp by which the heart 
Sees things unearthly; so thou art, 
Mighty spirit: so shall be 
The City that did refuge thee. 

Lo, the sun floats up the sky 
Like thought-winged Liberty, 
Till the universal light 
Seems to level plain and height; 
From the sea a mist has spread, 
And the beams of morn lie dead 
On the towers of Venice now, 
Like its glory long ago. 
By the skirts of that gray cloud 
Many-domed Padua proud 
Stands, a peopled solitude, 
'Mid the harvest-shining plain, 
Where the peasant heaps his grain 
In the garner of his foe, 
And the milk-white oxen slow 
With the purple vintage strain, 
Heap'd upon the creaking wain, 
That the brutal Celt may swill 
Drunken sleep with savage will; 
And the sickle to the sword 
Lies unchang'd though many a lord, 
Like a weed whose shade is poison, 
Overgrows this region's foison, 
Sheaves of whom are ripe to come 
To destruction's harvest-home: 
Men must reap the things they sow, 
Force from force must ever flow, 
Or worse; but 'tis a bitter woe 
That love or reason cannot change 
The despot's rage, the slave's revenge. 

Padua, thou within whose walls 
Those mute guests at festivals, 
Son and Mother, Death and Sin, 
Play'd at dice for Ezzelin, 
Till Death cried, 'I win, I win!' 
And Sin curs'd to lose the wager, 
But Death promis'd, to assuage her, 
That he would petition for 
Her to be made Vice-Emperor, 
When the destin'd years were o'er, 
Over all between the Po 
And the eastern Alpine snow, 
Under the mighty Austrian. 
Sin smil'd so as Sin only can, 
And since that time, ay, long before, 
Both have rul'd from shore to shore, 
That incestuous pair, who follow 
Tyrants as the sun the swallow, 
As Repentance follows Crime, 
And as changes follow Time. 

In thine halls the lamp of learning, 
Padua, now no more is burning; 
Like a meteor, whose wild way 
Is lost over the grave of day, 
It gleams betray'd and to betray: 
Once remotest nations came 
To adore that sacred flame, 
When it lit not many a hearth 
On this cold and gloomy earth: 
Now new fires from antique light 
Spring beneath the wide world's might; 
But their spark lies dead in thee, 
Trampled out by Tyranny. 
As the Norway woodman quells, 
In the depth of piny dells, 
One light flame among the brakes, 
While the boundless forest shakes, 
And its mighty trunks are torn 
By the fire thus lowly born: 
The spark beneath his feet is dead, 
He starts to see the flames it fed 
Howling through the darken'd sky 
With myriad tongues victoriously, 
And sinks down in fear: so thou, 
O Tyranny, beholdest now 
Light around thee, and thou hearest 
The loud flames ascend, and fearest: 
Grovel on the earth; ay, hide 
In the dust thy purple pride! 

Noon descends around me now: 
'Tis the noon of autumn's glow, 
When a soft and purple mist 
Like a vaporous amethyst, 
Or an air-dissolved star 
Mingling light and fragrance, far 
From the curv'd horizon's bound 
To the point of Heaven's profound, 
Fills the overflowing sky; 
And the plains that silent lie 
Underneath, the leaves unsodden 
Where the infant Frost has trodden 
With his morning-winged feet, 
Whose bright print is gleaming yet; 
And the red and golden vines, 
Piercing with their trellis'd lines 
The rough, dark-skirted wilderness; 
The dun and bladed grass no less, 
Pointing from his hoary tower 
In the windless air; the flower 
Glimmering at my feet; the line 
Of the olive-sandall'd Apennine 
In the south dimly islanded; 
And the Alps, whose snows are spread 
High between the clouds and sun; 
And of living things each one; 
And my spirit which so long 
Darken'd this swift stream of song, 
Interpenetrated lie 
By the glory of the sky: 
Be it love, light, harmony, 
Odour, or the soul of all 
Which from Heaven like dew doth fall, 
Or the mind which feeds this verse 
Peopling the lone universe. 

Noon descends, and after noon 
Autumn's evening meets me soon, 
Leading the infantine moon, 
And that one star, which to her 
Almost seems to minister 
Half the crimson light she brings 
From the sunset's radiant springs: 
And the soft dreams of the morn 
(Which like winged winds had borne 
To that silent isle, which lies 
Mid remember'd agonies, 
The frail bark of this lone being) 
Pass, to other sufferers fleeing, 
And its ancient pilot, Pain, 
Sits beside the helm again. 

Other flowering isles must be 
In the sea of Life and Agony: 
Other spirits float and flee 
O'er that gulf: even now, perhaps, 
On some rock the wild wave wraps, 
With folded wings they waiting sit 
For my bark, to pilot it 
To some calm and blooming cove, 
Where for me, and those I love, 
May a windless bower be built, 
Far from passion, pain and guilt, 
In a dell mid lawny hills, 
Which the wild sea-murmur fills, 
And soft sunshine, and the sound 
Of old forests echoing round, 
And the light and smell divine 
Of all flowers that breathe and shine: 
We may live so happy there, 
That the Spirits of the Air, 
Envying us, may even entice 
To our healing paradise 
The polluting multitude; 
But their rage would be subdu'd 
By that clime divine and calm, 
And the winds whose wings rain balm 
On the uplifted soul, and leaves 
Under which the bright sea heaves; 
While each breathless interval 
In their whisperings musical 
The inspired soul supplies 
With its own deep melodies, 
And the love which heals all strife 
Circling, like the breath of life, 
All things in that sweet abode 
With its own mild brotherhood: 
They, not it, would change; and soon 
Every sprite beneath the moon 
Would repent its envy vain, 
And the earth grow young again.
#END#
She left me at the silent time
When the moon had ceas'd to climb
The azure path of Heaven's steep,
And like an albatross asleep,
Balanc'd on her wings of light,
Hover'd in the purple night,
Ere she sought her ocean nest
In the chambers of the West.
She left me, and I stay'd alone
Thinking over every tone
Which, though silent to the ear,
The enchanted heart could hear,
Like notes which die when born, but still
Haunt the echoes of the hill;
And feeling everoh, too much!
The soft vibration of her touch,
As if her gentle hand, even now,
Lightly trembled on my brow;
And thus, although she absent were,
Memory gave me all of her
That even Fancy dares to claim:
Her presence had made weak and tame
All passions, and I lived alone
In the time which is our own;
The past and future were forgot,
As they had been, and would be, not.
But soon, the guardian angel gone,
The daemon reassum'd his throne
In my faint heart. I dare not speak
My thoughts, but thus disturb'd and weak
I sat and saw the vessels glide
Over the ocean bright and wide,
Like spirit-winged chariots sent
O'er some serenest element
For ministrations strange and far,
As if to some Elysian star
Sailed for drink to medicine
Such sweet and bitter pain as mine.
And the wind that wing'd their flight
From the land came fresh and light,
And the scent of winged flowers,
And the coolness of the hours
Of dew, and sweet warmth left by day,
Were scatter'd o'er the twinkling bay.
And the fisher with his lamp
And spear about the low rocks damp
Crept, and struck the fish which came
To worship the delusive flame.
Too happy they, whose pleasure sought
Extinguishes all sense and thought
Of the regret that pleasure leaves,
Destroying life alone, not peace!
#END#
The cold earth slept below; 
         Above the cold sky shone; 
                And all around, 
                With a chilling sound, 
From caves of ice and fields of snow 
The breath of night like death did flow 
                Beneath the sinking moon. 

The wintry hedge was black; 
         The green grass was not seen; 
                The birds did rest 
                On the bare thorn’s breast, 
Whose roots, beside the pathway track, 
Had bound their folds o’er many a crack 
                Which the frost had made between. 

Thine eyes glow’d in the glare 
         Of the moon’s dying light; 
                As a fen-fire’s beam 
                On a sluggish stream 
Gleams dimly—so the moon shone there, 
And it yellow’d the strings of thy tangled hair, 
                That shook in the wind of night. 

The moon made thy lips pale, beloved; 
         The wind made thy bosom chill; 
                The night did shed 
                On thy dear head 
Its frozen dew, and thou didst lie 
Where the bitter breath of the naked sky 
                Might visit thee at will.
#END#
The fountains mingle with the river 
   And the rivers with the ocean, 
The winds of heaven mix for ever 
   With a sweet emotion; 
Nothing in the world is single; 
   All things by a law divine 
In one spirit meet and mingle. 
   Why not I with thine?— 

See the mountains kiss high heaven 
   And the waves clasp one another; 
No sister-flower would be forgiven 
   If it disdained its brother; 
And the sunlight clasps the earth 
   And the moonbeams kiss the sea: 
What is all this sweet work worth 
   If thou kiss not me?

The everlasting universe of things 
Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, 
Now dark—now glittering—now reflecting gloom— 
Now lending splendour, where from secret springs 
The source of human thought its tribute brings 
Of waters—with a sound but half its own, 
Such as a feeble brook will oft assume, 
In the wild woods, among the mountains lone, 
Where waterfalls around it leap for ever, 
Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river 
Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves. 

                                     II 
Thus thou, Ravine of Arve—dark, deep Ravine— 
Thou many-colour'd, many-voiced vale, 
Over whose pines, and crags, and caverns sail 
Fast cloud-shadows and sunbeams: awful scene, 
Where Power in likeness of the Arve comes down 
From the ice-gulfs that gird his secret throne, 
Bursting through these dark mountains like the flame 
Of lightning through the tempest;—thou dost lie, 
Thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging, 
Children of elder time, in whose devotion 
The chainless winds still come and ever came 
To drink their odours, and their mighty swinging 
To hear—an old and solemn harmony; 
Thine earthly rainbows stretch'd across the sweep 
Of the aethereal waterfall, whose veil 
Robes some unsculptur'd image; the strange sleep 
Which when the voices of the desert fail 
Wraps all in its own deep eternity; 
Thy caverns echoing to the Arve's commotion, 
A loud, lone sound no other sound can tame; 
Thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion, 
Thou art the path of that unresting sound— 
Dizzy Ravine! and when I gaze on thee 
I seem as in a trance sublime and strange 
To muse on my own separate fantasy, 
My own, my human mind, which passively 
Now renders and receives fast influencings, 
Holding an unremitting interchange 
With the clear universe of things around; 
One legion of wild thoughts, whose wandering wings 
Now float above thy darkness, and now rest 
Where that or thou art no unbidden guest, 
In the still cave of the witch Poesy, 
Seeking among the shadows that pass by 
Ghosts of all things that are, some shade of thee, 
Some phantom, some faint image; till the breast 
From which they fled recalls them, thou art there! 

                                     III 
Some say that gleams of a remoter world 
Visit the soul in sleep, that death is slumber, 
And that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber 
Of those who wake and live.—I look on high; 
Has some unknown omnipotence unfurl'd 
The veil of life and death? or do I lie 
In dream, and does the mightier world of sleep 
Spread far around and inaccessibly 
Its circles? For the very spirit fails, 
Driven like a homeless cloud from steep to steep 
That vanishes among the viewless gales! 
Far, far above, piercing the infinite sky, 
Mont Blanc appears—still, snowy, and serene; 
Its subject mountains their unearthly forms 
Pile around it, ice and rock; broad vales between 
Of frozen floods, unfathomable deeps, 
Blue as the overhanging heaven, that spread 
And wind among the accumulated steeps; 
A desert peopled by the storms alone, 
Save when the eagle brings some hunter's bone, 
And the wolf tracks her there—how hideously 
Its shapes are heap'd around! rude, bare, and high, 
Ghastly, and scarr'd, and riven.—Is this the scene 
Where the old Earthquake-daemon taught her young 
Ruin? Were these their toys? or did a sea 
Of fire envelop once this silent snow? 
None can reply—all seems eternal now. 
The wilderness has a mysterious tongue 
Which teaches awful doubt, or faith so mild, 
So solemn, so serene, that man may be, 
But for such faith, with Nature reconcil'd; 
Thou hast a voice, great Mountain, to repeal 
Large codes of fraud and woe; not understood 
By all, but which the wise, and great, and good 
Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel. 

                                     IV 
The fields, the lakes, the forests, and the streams, 
Ocean, and all the living things that dwell 
Within the daedal earth; lightning, and rain, 
Earthquake, and fiery flood, and hurricane, 
The torpor of the year when feeble dreams 
Visit the hidden buds, or dreamless sleep 
Holds every future leaf and flower; the bound 
With which from that detested trance they leap; 
The works and ways of man, their death and birth, 
And that of him and all that his may be; 
All things that move and breathe with toil and sound 
Are born and die; revolve, subside, and swell. 
Power dwells apart in its tranquillity, 
Remote, serene, and inaccessible: 
And this, the naked countenance of earth, 
On which I gaze, even these primeval mountains 
Teach the adverting mind. The glaciers creep 
Like snakes that watch their prey, from their far fountains, 
Slow rolling on; there, many a precipice 
Frost and the Sun in scorn of mortal power 
Have pil'd: dome, pyramid, and pinnacle, 
A city of death, distinct with many a tower 
And wall impregnable of beaming ice. 
Yet not a city, but a flood of ruin 
Is there, that from the boundaries of the sky 
Rolls its perpetual stream; vast pines are strewing 
Its destin'd path, or in the mangled soil 
Branchless and shatter'd stand; the rocks, drawn down 
From yon remotest waste, have overthrown 
The limits of the dead and living world, 
Never to be reclaim'd. The dwelling-place 
Of insects, beasts, and birds, becomes its spoil; 
Their food and their retreat for ever gone, 
So much of life and joy is lost. The race 
Of man flies far in dread; his work and dwelling 
Vanish, like smoke before the tempest's stream, 
And their place is not known. Below, vast caves 
Shine in the rushing torrents' restless gleam, 
Which from those secret chasms in tumult welling 
Meet in the vale, and one majestic River, 
The breath and blood of distant lands, for ever 
Rolls its loud waters to the ocean-waves, 
Breathes its swift vapours to the circling air. 

                                     V 
Mont Blanc yet gleams on high:—the power is there, 
The still and solemn power of many sights, 
And many sounds, and much of life and death. 
In the calm darkness of the moonless nights, 
In the lone glare of day, the snows descend 
Upon that Mountain; none beholds them there, 
Nor when the flakes burn in the sinking sun, 
Or the star-beams dart through them. Winds contend 
Silently there, and heap the snow with breath 
Rapid and strong, but silently! Its home 
The voiceless lightning in these solitudes 
Keeps innocently, and like vapour broods 
Over the snow. The secret Strength of things 
Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome 
Of Heaven is as a law, inhabits thee! 
And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea, 
If to the human mind's imaginings 
Silence and solitude were vacancy?
#END#
Music, when soft voices die,
Vibrates in the memory
Odours, when sweet violets sicken,
Live within the sense they quicken.

   Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,
Are heaped for the belovèd's bed;
And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,
Love itself shall slumber on.
#END#
The flower that smiles to-day 
          To-morrow dies; 
All that we wish to stay 
          Tempts and then flies. 
What is this world's delight? 
Lightning that mocks the night, 
          Brief even as bright. 

   Virtue, how frail it is! 
          Friendship how rare! 
Love, how it sells poor bliss 
          For proud despair! 
But we, though soon they fall, 
Survive their joy, and all 
          Which ours we call. 

   Whilst skies are blue and bright, 
          Whilst flowers are gay, 
Whilst eyes that change ere night 
          Make glad the day; 
Whilst yet the calm hours creep, 
Dream thou—and from thy sleep 
          Then wake to weep.
#END#
I. 
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; 
    How restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soon
Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:—

                                         II.
Or like forgotten lyres whose dissonant strings
    Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
    One mood or modulation like the last.

                                        III.
We rest—a dream  has power to poison sleep; 
    We rise—one wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep,
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:—

                                       IV.
It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,
    The path of its departure still is free;
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
    Nought may endure but Mutability.

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, 
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead 
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing, 

Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, 
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, 
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed 

The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low, 
Each like a corpse within its grave, until 
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow 

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill 
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) 
With living hues and odours plain and hill: 

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; 
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear! 

II 
Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion, 
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed, 
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean, 

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread 
On the blue surface of thine aëry surge, 
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head 

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge 
Of the horizon to the zenith's height, 
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge 

Of the dying year, to which this closing night 
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre, 
Vaulted with all thy congregated might 

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere 
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear! 

III 
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams 
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay, 
Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams, 

Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay, 
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers 
Quivering within the wave's intenser day, 

All overgrown with azure moss and flowers 
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou 
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers 

Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below 
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear 
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know 

Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear, 
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear! 

IV 
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear; 
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee; 
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share 

The impulse of thy strength, only less free 
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even 
I were as in my boyhood, and could be 

The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven, 
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed 
Scarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven 

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need. 
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud! 
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed! 

A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd 
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud. 

V 
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is: 
What if my leaves are falling like its own! 
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies 

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone, 
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce, 
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one! 

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe 
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth! 
And, by the incantation of this verse, 

Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth 
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind! 
Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth 

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind, 
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?
#END#
One sung of thee who left the tale untold,
         Like the false dawns which perish in the bursting;
Like empty cups of wrought and daedal gold,
         Which mock the lips with air, when they are thirsting.

I met a traveller from an antique land, 
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, 
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, 
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, 
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read 
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, 
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; 
And on the pedestal, these words appear: 
My name is OzymandiasOzymandias Pharaoh Rameses II (reigned 1279-1213 BCE). According to the OED, the statue was once 57 feet tall., King of Kings; 
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! 
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare 
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

(excerpt)  SCENE.—A Ravine of Icy Rocks in the Indian Caucasus. Prometheus is discovered bound to the Precipice. Panthea and Ione are seated at his feet. Time, night. During the Scene, morning slowly breaks.
Prometheus. 
   Monarch of Gods and Dæmons, and all Spirits 
But One, who throng those bright and rolling worlds 
Which Thou and I alone of living things 
Behold with sleepless eyes! regard this Earth 
Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou 
Requitest for knee-worship, prayer, and praise, 
And toil, and hecatombs of broken hearts, 
With fear and self-contempt and barren hope. 
Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate, 
Hast thou made reign and triumph, to thy scorn, 
O'er mine own misery and thy vain revenge. 
Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours, 
And moments aye divided by keen pangs 
Till they seemed years, torture and solitude, 
Scorn and despair,—these are mine empire:— 
More glorious far than that which thou surveyest 
From thine unenvied throne, O Mighty God! 
Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame 
Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here 
Nailed to this wall of eagle-baffling mountain, 
Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured; without herb, 
Insect, or beast, or shape or sound of life. 
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever! 

   No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure. 
I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt? 
I ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun, 
Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm, 
Heaven's ever-changing Shadow, spread below, 
Have its deaf waves not heard my agony? 
Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever! 

   The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears 
Of their moon-freezing crystals, the bright chains 
Eat with their burning cold into my bones. 
Heaven's wingèd hound, polluting from thy lips 
His beak in poison not his own, tears up 
My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by, 
The ghastly people of the realm of dream, 
Mocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are charged 
To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds 
When the rocks split and close again behind: 
While from their loud abysses howling throng 
The genii of the storm, urging the rage 
Of whirlwind, and afflict me with keen hail. 
And yet to me welcome is day and night, 
Whether one breaks the hoar frost of the morn, 
Or starry, dim, and slow, the other climbs 
The leaden-coloured east; for then they lead 
The wingless, crawling hours, one among whom 
—As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim— 
Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood 
From these pale feet, which then might trample thee 
If they disdained not such a prostrate slave. 
Disdain! Ah no! I pity thee. What ruin 
Will hunt thee undefended through wide Heaven! 
How will thy soul, cloven to its depth with terror, 
Gape like a hell within! I speak in grief, 
Not exultation, for I hate no more, 
As then ere misery made me wise. The curse 
Once breathed on thee I would recall. Ye Mountains, 
Whose many-voicèd Echoes, through the mist 
Of cataracts, flung the thunder of that spell! 
Ye icy Springs, stagnant with wrinkling frost, 
Which vibrated to hear me, and then crept 
Shuddering through India! Thou serenest Air, 
Through which the Sun walks burning without beams! 
And ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poisèd wings 
Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss, 
As thunder, louder than your own, made rock 
The orbèd world! If then my words had power, 
Though I am changed so that aught evil wish 
Is dead within; although no memory be 
Of what is hate, let them not lose it now! 
What was that curse? for ye all heard me speak.

"Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light, 
Of which yon earth is one, is wide diffus'd 
A Spirit of activity and life, 
That knows no term, cessation, or decay; 
That fades not when the lamp of earthly life, 
Extinguish'd in the dampness of the grave, 
Awhile there slumbers, more than when the babe 
In the dim newness of its being feels 
The impulses of sublunary things, 
And all is wonder to unpractis'd sense: 
But, active, steadfast and eternal, still 
Guides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest roars, 
Cheers in the day, breathes in the balmy groves, 
Strengthens in health, and poisons in disease; 
And in the storm of change, that ceaselessly 
Rolls round the eternal universe and shakes 
Its undecaying battlement, presides, 
Apportioning with irresistible law 
The place each spring of its machine shall fill; 
So that when waves on waves tumultuous heap 
Confusion to the clouds, and fiercely driven 
Heaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords, 
Whilst, to the eye of shipwreck'd mariner, 
Lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock, 
All seems unlink'd contingency and chance, 
No atom of this turbulence fulfils 
A vague and unnecessitated task, 
Or acts but as it must and ought to act. 
Even the minutest molecule of light, 
That in an April sunbeam's fleeting glow 
Fulfils its destin'd, though invisible work, 
The universal Spirit guides; nor less, 
When merciless ambition, or mad zeal, 
Has led two hosts of dupes to battlefield, 
That, blind, they there may dig each other's graves, 
And call the sad work glory, does it rule 
All passions: not a thought, a will, an act, 
No working of the tyrant's moody mind, 
Nor one misgiving of the slaves who boast 
Their servitude to hide the shame they feel, 
Nor the events enchaining every will, 
That from the depths of unrecorded time 
Have drawn all-influencing virtue, pass 
Unrecogniz'd or unforeseen by thee, 
Soul of the Universe! eternal spring 
Of life and death, of happiness and woe, 
Of all that chequers the phantasmal scene 
That floats before our eyes in wavering light, 
Which gleams but on the darkness of our prison, 
       Whose chains and massy walls 
       We feel, but cannot see. 

"Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power, 
Necessity! thou mother of the world! 
Unlike the God of human error, thou 
Requir'st no prayers or praises; the caprice 
Of man's weak will belongs no more to thee 
Than do the changeful passions of his breast 
To thy unvarying harmony: the slave, 
Whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world, 
And the good man, who lifts with virtuous pride 
His being in the sight of happiness 
That springs from his own works; the poison-tree, 
Beneath whose shade all life is wither'd up, 
And the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords 
A temple where the vows of happy love 
Are register'd, are equal in thy sight: 
No love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge 
And favouritism, and worst desire of fame 
Thou know'st not: all that the wide world contains 
Are but thy passive instruments, and thou 
Regard'st them all with an impartial eye, 
Whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel, 
         Because thou hast not human sense, 
         Because thou art not human mind. 

         "Yes! when the sweeping storm of time 
Has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruin'd fanes 
And broken altars of the almighty Fiend 
Whose name usurps thy honours, and the blood 
Through centuries clotted there has floated down 
The tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live 
Unchangeable! A shrine is rais'd to thee, 
         Which, nor the tempest-breath of time, 
         Nor the interminable flood 
         Over earth's slight pageant rolling, 
                Availeth to destroy— 
The sensitive extension of the world. 
         That wondrous and eternal fane, 
Where pain and pleasure, good and evil join, 
To do the will of strong necessity, 
         And life, in multitudinous shapes, 
Still pressing forward where no term can be, 
         Like hungry and unresting flame 
Curls round the eternal columns of its strength."
#END#
Rarely, rarely, comest thou,
         Spirit of Delight!
Wherefore hast thou left me now
         Many a day and night?
Many a weary night and day
'Tis since thou are fled away.

How shall ever one like me
         Win thee back again?
With the joyous and the free
         Thou wilt scoff at pain.
Spirit false! thou hast forgot
All but those who need thee not.

As a lizard with the shade
         Of a trembling leaf,
Thou with sorrow art dismay'd;
         Even the sighs of grief
Reproach thee, that thou art not near,
And reproach thou wilt not hear.

Let me set my mournful ditty
         To a merry measure;
Thou wilt never come for pity,
         Thou wilt come for pleasure;
Pity then will cut away
Those cruel wings, and thou wilt stay.

I love all that thou lovest,
         Spirit of Delight!
The fresh Earth in new leaves dress'd,
         And the starry night;
Autumn evening, and the morn
When the golden mists are born.

I love snow, and all the forms
         Of the radiant frost;
I love waves, and winds, and storms,
         Everything almost
Which is Nature's, and may be
Untainted by man's misery.

I love tranquil solitude,
         And such society
As is quiet, wise, and good;
         Between thee and me
What difference? but thou dost possess
The things I seek, not love them less.

I love Lovethough he has wings,
         And like light can flee,
But above all other things,
         Spirit, I love thee
Thou art love and life! Oh come,
Make once more my heart thy home.
#END#
The sun is warm, the sky is clear, 
         The waves are dancing fast and bright, 
      Blue isles and snowy mountains wear 
      The purple noon's transparent might, 
         The breath of the moist earth is light, 
      Around its unexpanded buds; 
         Like many a voice of one delight, 
      The winds, the birds, the ocean floods, 
The City's voice itself, is soft like Solitude's. 

         I see the Deep's untrampled floor 
         With green and purple seaweeds strown; 
      I see the waves upon the shore, 
      Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown: 
         I sit upon the sands alone,— 
      The lightning of the noontide ocean 
         Is flashing round me, and a tone 
      Arises from its measured motion, 
How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion. 

         Alas! I have nor hope nor health, 
         Nor peace within nor calm around, 
      Nor that content surpassing wealth 
      The sage in meditation found, 
         And walked with inward glory crowned— 
      Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor leisure. 
         Others I see whom these surround— 
      Smiling they live, and call life pleasure; 
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure. 

         Yet now despair itself is mild, 
         Even as the winds and waters are; 
      I could lie down like a tired child, 
      And weep away the life of care 
         Which I have borne and yet must bear, 
      Till death like sleep might steal on me, 
         And I might feel in the warm air 
      My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea 
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony. 

         Some might lament that I were cold, 
         As I, when this sweet day is gone, 
      Which my lost heart, too soon grown old, 
      Insults with this untimely moan; 
         They might lament—for I am one 
      Whom men love not,—and yet regret, 
         Unlike this day, which, when the sun 
      Shall on its stainless glory set, 
Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.
#END#
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
         From the seas and the streams;
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
         In their noonday dreams.
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
         The sweet buds every one,
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
         As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
         And whiten the green plains under,
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
         And laugh as I pass in thunder.

   I sift the snow on the mountains below,
         And their great pines groan aghast;
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
         While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,
         Lightning my pilot sits;
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,
         It struggles and howls at fits;
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
         This pilot is guiding me,
Lured by the love of the genii that move
         In the depths of the purple sea;
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,
         Over the lakes and the plains,
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,
         The Spirit he loves remains;
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,
         Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

   The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,
         And his burning plumes outspread,
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,
         When the morning star shines dead;
As on the jag of a mountain crag,
         Which an earthquake rocks and swings,
An eagle alit one moment may sit
         In the light of its golden wings.
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,
         Its ardours of rest and of love,
And the crimson pall of eve may fall
         From the depth of Heaven above,
With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest,
         As still as a brooding dove.

   That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,
         Whom mortals call the Moon,
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,
         By the midnight breezes strewn;
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,
         Which only the angels hear,
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,
         The stars peep behind her and peer;
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,
         Like a swarm of golden bees,
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,
         Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,
         Are each paved with the moon and these.

   I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,
         And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,
         When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,
         Over a torrent sea,
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,
         The mountains its columns be.
The triumphal arch through which I march
         With hurricane, fire, and snow,
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,
         Is the million-coloured bow;
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,
         While the moist Earth was laughing below.

   I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
         And the nursling of the Sky;
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
         I change, but I cannot die.
For after the rain when with never a stain
         The pavilion of Heaven is bare,
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
         Build up the blue dome of air,
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
         And out of the caverns of rain,
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
         I arise and unbuild it again.
#END#
The fitful alternations of the rain,
When the chill wind, languid as with pain
Of its own heavy moisture, here and there
Drives through the gray and beamless atmosphere.
#END#
I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night,
When the winds are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright:
I arise from dreams of thee,
And a spirit in my feet
Hath led mewho knows how?
To thy chamber window, Sweet!

   The wandering airs they faint
On the dark, the silent stream
The Champak odours fail
Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
The Nightingale's complaint,
It dies upon her heart;
As I must on thine,
Oh, belovèd as thou art!

   Oh lift me from the grass!
I die! I faint! I fail!
Let thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids pale.
My cheek is cold and white, alas!
My heart beats loud and fast;
Oh! press it to thine own again,
Where it will break at last.
#END#
I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way,
         Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,
And gentle odours led my steps astray,
         Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring
Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay
         Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,
But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream.

   There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,
         Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,
The constellated flower that never sets;
         Faint oxlips; tender bluebells, at whose birth
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets
         Like a child, half in tenderness and mirth
Its mother's face with Heaven's collected tears,
When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.

   And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,
         Green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured may,
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine
         Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the day;
And wild roses, and ivy serpentine,
         With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;
And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,
Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.

   And nearer to the river's trembling edge
         There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with white,
And starry river buds among the sedge,
         And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
         With moonlight beams of their own watery light;
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.

   Methought that of these visionary flowers
         I made a nosegay, bound in such a way
That the same hues, which in their natural bowers
         Were mingled or opposed, the like array
Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours
         Within my hand,and then, elate and gay,
I hastened to the spot whence I had come,
That I might there present it!Oh! to whom?
#END#
Swift as a spirit hastening to his task
Of glory & of good, the Sun sprang forth
Rejoicing in his splendour, & the mask
Of darkness fell from the awakened Earth.
The smokeless altars of the mountain snows
Flamed above crimson clouds, & at the birth
Of light, the Ocean's orison arose
To which the birds tempered their matin lay,
All flowers in field or forest which unclose
Their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day,
Swinging their censers in the element,
With orient incense lit by the new ray
Burned slow & inconsumably, & sent
Their odorous sighs up to the smiling air,
And in succession due, did Continent,
Isle, Ocean, & all things that in them wear
The form & character of mortal mould
Rise as the Sun their father rose, to bear
Their portion of the toil which he of old
Took as his own & then imposed on them;
But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold
Had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem
The cone of night, now they were laid asleep,
Stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem
Which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep
Of a green Apennine: before me fled
The night; behind me rose the day; the Deep
Was at my feet, & Heaven above my head
When a strange trance over my fancy grew
Which was not slumber, for the shade it spread
Was so transparent that the scene came through
As clear as when a veil of light is drawn
O'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew
That I had felt the freshness of that dawn,
Bathed in the same cold dew my brow & hair
And sate as thus upon that slope of lawn
Under the self same bough, & heard as there
The birds, the fountains & the Ocean hold
Sweet talk in music through the enamoured air.
And then a Vision on my brain was rolled.

As in that trance of wondrous thought I lay
This was the tenour of my waking dream.
Methought I sate beside a public way
Thick strewn with summer dust, & a great stream
Of people there was hurrying to & fro
Numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,
All hastening onward, yet none seemed to know
Whither he went, or whence he came, or why
He made one of the multitude, yet so
Was borne amid the crowd as through the sky
One of the million leaves of summer's bier.
Old age & youth, manhood & infancy,
Mixed in one mighty torrent did appear,
Some flying from the thing they feared & some
Seeking the object of another's fear,
And others as with steps towards the tomb
Pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,
And others mournfully within the gloom
Of their own shadow walked, and called it death ...
And some fled from it as it were a ghost,
Half fainting in the affliction of vain breath.
But more with motions which each other crost
Pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw
Or birds within the noonday ether lost,
Upon that path where flowers never grew;
And weary with vain toil & faint for thirst
Heard not the fountains whose melodious dew
Out of their mossy cells forever burst
Nor felt the breeze which from the forest told
Of grassy paths, & wood lawns interspersed
With overarching elms & caverns cold,
And violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they
Pursued their serious folly as of old ....
And as I gazed methought that in the way
The throng grew wilder, as the woods of June
When the South wind shakes the extinguished day.
And a cold glare, intenser than the noon
But icy cold, obscured with [[blank]] light
The Sun as he the stars. Like the young moon
When on the sunlit limits of the night
Her white shell trembles amid crimson air
And whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might
Doth, as a herald of its coming, bear
The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim form
Bends in dark ether from her infant's chair,
So came a chariot on the silent storm
Of its own rushing splendour, and a Shape
So sate within as one whom years deform
Beneath a dusky hood & double cape
Crouching within the shadow of a tomb,
And o'er what seemed the head, a cloud like crape,
Was bent a dun & faint etherial gloom
Tempering the light; upon the chariot's beam
A Janus-visaged Shadow did assume
The guidance of that wonder-winged team.
The Shapes which drew it in thick lightnings
Were lost: I heard alone on the air's soft stream
The music of their ever moving wings.
All the four faces of that charioteer
Had their eyes banded . . . little profit brings
Speed in the van & blindness in the rear,
Nor then avail the beams that quench the Sun
Or that his banded eyes could pierce the sphere
Of all that is, has been, or will be done.
So ill was the car guided, but it past
With solemn speed majestically on . . .
The crowd gave way, & I arose aghast,
Or seemed to rise, so mighty was the trance,
And saw like clouds upon the thunder blast
The million with fierce song and maniac dance
Raging around; such seemed the jubilee
As when to greet some conqueror's advance
Imperial Rome poured forth her living sea
From senatehouse & prison & theatre
When Freedom left those who upon the free
Had bound a yoke which soon they stooped to bear.
Nor wanted here the true similitude
Of a triumphal pageant, for where'er
The chariot rolled a captive multitude
Was driven; althose who had grown old in power
Or misery,all who have their age subdued,
By action or by suffering, and whose hour
Was drained to its last sand in weal or woe,
So that the trunk survived both fruit & flower;
All those whose fame or infamy must grow
Till the great winter lay the form & name
Of their own earth with them forever low,
All but the sacred few who could not tame
Their spirits to the Conqueror, but as soon
As they had touched the world with living flame
Fled back like eagles to their native noon,
Of those who put aside the diadem
Of earthly thrones or gems, till the last one
Were there;for they of Athens & Jerusalem
Were neither mid the mighty captives seen
Nor mid the ribald crowd that followed them
Or fled before . . Now swift, fierce & obscene
The wild dance maddens in the van, & those
Who lead it, fleet as shadows on the green,
Outspeed the chariot & without repose
Mix with each other in tempestuous measure
To savage music .... Wilder as it grows,
They, tortured by the agonizing pleasure,
Convulsed & on the rapid whirlwinds spun
Of that fierce spirit, whose unholy leisure
Was soothed by mischief since the world begun,
Throw back their heads & loose their streaming hair,
And in their dance round her who dims the Sun
Maidens & youths fling their wild arms in air
As their feet twinkle; they recede, and now
Bending within each other's atmosphere
Kindle invisibly; and as they glow
Like moths by light attracted & repelled,
Oft to new bright destruction come & go.
Till like two clouds into one vale impelled
That shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle
And die in rain,the fiery band which held
Their natures, snaps . . . ere the shock cease to tingle
One falls and then another in the path
Senseless, nor is the desolation single,
Yet ere I can say  where the chariot hath
Past over them; nor other trace I find
But as of foam after the Ocean's wrath
Is spent upon the desert shore.Behind,
Old men, and women foully disarrayed
Shake their grey hair in the insulting wind,
Limp in the dance & strain, with limbs decayed,
Seeking to reach the light which leaves them still
Farther behind & deeper in the shade.
But not the less with impotence of will
They wheel, though ghastly shadows interpose
Round them & round each other, and fulfill
Their work and to the dust whence they arose
Sink & corruption veils them as they lie
And frost in these performs what fire in those.
Struck to the heart by this sad pageantry,
Half to myself I said, "And what is this?
Whose shape is that within the car? & why"-
I would have added"is all here amiss?"
But a voice answered . . "Life" . . . I turned & knew
(O Heaven have mercy on such wretchedness!)
That what I thought was an old root which grew
To strange distortion out of the hill side
Was indeed one of that deluded crew,
And that the grass which methought hung so wide
And white, was but his thin discoloured hair,
And that the holes it vainly sought to hide
Were or had been eyes."lf thou canst forbear
To join the dance, which I had well forborne,"
Said the grim Feature, of my thought aware,
"I will now tell that which to this deep scorn
Led me & my companions, and relate
The progress of the pageant since the morn;
"If thirst of knowledge doth not thus abate,
Follow it even to the night, but I
Am weary" . . . Then like one who with the weight
Of his own words is staggered, wearily
He paused, and ere he could resume, I cried,
"First who art thou?" . . . "Before thy memory
"I feared, loved, hated, suffered, did, & died,
And if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit
Earth had with purer nutriment supplied
"Corruption would not now thus much inherit
Of what was once Rousseaunor this disguise
Stained that within which still disdains to wear it.
"If I have been extinguished, yet there rise
A thousand beacons from the spark I bore."
"And who are those chained to the car?" "The Wise,
"The great, the unforgotten: they who wore
Mitres & helms & crowns, or wreathes of light,
Signs of thought's empire over thought; their lore
"Taught them not thisto know themselves; their might
Could not repress the mutiny within,
And for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night
"Caught them ere evening." "Who is he with chin
Upon his breast and hands crost on his chain?"
"The Child of a fierce hour; he sought to win
"The world, and lost all it did contain
Of greatness, in its hope destroyed; & more
Of fame & peace than Virtue's self can gain
"Without the opportunity which bore
Him on its eagle's pinion to the peak
From which a thousand climbers have before
"Fall'n as Napoleon fell."I felt my cheek
Alter to see the great form pass away
Whose grasp had left the giant world so weak
That every pigmy kicked it as it lay
And much I grieved to think how power & will
In opposition rule our mortal day
And why God made irreconcilable
Good & the means of good; and for despair
I half disdained mine eye's desire to fill
With the spent vision of the times that were
And scarce have ceased to be . . . "Dost thou behold,"
Said then my guide, "those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire,
"Frederic, & Kant, Catherine, & Leopold,
Chained hoary anarch, demagogue & sage
Whose name the fresh world thinks already old
"For in the battle Life & they did wage
She remained conquerorI was overcome
By my own heart alone, which neither age
"Nor tears nor infamy nor now the tomb
Could temper to its object.""Let them pass"
I cried"the world & its mysterious doom
"Is not so much more glorious than it was
That I desire to worship those who drew
New figures on its false & fragile glass
"As the old faded.""Figures ever new
Rise on the bubble, paint them how you may;
We have but thrown, as those before us threw,
"Our shadows on it as it past away.
But mark, how chained to the triumphal chair
The mighty phantoms of an elder day
"All that is mortal of great Plato there
Expiates the joy & woe his master knew not;
That star that ruled his doom was far too fair
"And Life, where long that flower of Heaven grew not,
Conquered the heart by love which gold or pain
Or age or sloth or slavery could subdue not
"And near [[blank]] walk the [[blank]] twain,
The tutor & his pupil, whom Dominion
Followed as tame as vulture in a chain.
"The world was darkened beneath either pinion
Of him whom from the flock of conquerors
Fame singled as her thunderbearing minion;
"The other long outlived both woes & wars,
Throned in new thoughts of men, and still had kept
The jealous keys of truth's eternal doors
"If Bacon's spirit [[blank]] had not leapt
Like lightning out of darkness; he compelled
The Proteus shape of Nature's as it slept
"To wake & to unbar the caves that held
The treasure of the secrets of its reign
See the great bards of old who inly quelled
"The passions which they sung, as by their strain
May well be known: their living melody
Tempers its own contagion to the vein
"Of those who are infected with itI
Have suffered what I wrote, or viler pain!
"And so my words were seeds of misery
Even as the deeds of others.""Not as theirs,"
I saidhe pointed to a company
In which I recognized amid the heirs
Of Caesar's crime from him to Constantine,
The Anarchs old whose force & murderous snares
Had founded many a sceptre bearing line
And spread the plague of blood & gold abroad,
And Gregory & John and men divine
Who rose like shadows between Man & god
Till that eclipse, still hanging under Heaven,
Was worshipped by the world o'er which they strode
For the true Sun it quenched."Their power was given
But to destroy," replied the leader"I
Am one of those who have created, even
"If it be but a world of agony."
"Whence camest thou & whither goest thou?
How did thy course begin," I said, "& why?
"Mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow
Of people, & my heart of one sad thought.
Speak.""Whence I came, partly I seem to know,
"And how & by what paths I have been brought
To this dread pass, methinks even thou mayst guess;
Why this should be my mind can compass not;
"Whither the conqueror hurries me still less.
But follow thou, & from spectator turn
Actor or victim in this wretchedness,
"And what thou wouldst be taught I then may learn
From thee.Now listen . . . In the April prime
When all the forest tops began to burn
"With kindling green, touched by the azure clime
Of the young year, I found myself asleep
Under a mountain which from unknown time
"Had yawned into a cavern high & deep,
And from it came a gentle rivulet
Whose water like clear air in its calm sweep
"Bent the soft grass & kept for ever wet
The stems of the sweet flowers, and filled the grove
With sound which all who hear must needs forget
"All pleasure & all pain, all hate & love,
Which they had known before that hour of rest:
A sleeping mother then would dream not of
"The only child who died upon her breast
At eventide, a king would mourn no more
The crown of which his brow was dispossest
"When the sun lingered o'er the Ocean floor
To gild his rival's new prosperity.
Thou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore
"Ills, which if ills, can find no cure from thee,
The thought of which no other sleep will quell
Nor other music blot from memory
"So sweet & deep is the oblivious spell.
Whether my life had been before that sleep
The Heaven which I imagine, or a Hell
"Like this harsh world in which I wake to weep,
I know not. I arose & for a space
The scene of woods & waters seemed to keep,
"Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace
Of light diviner than the common Sun
Sheds on the common Earth, but all the place
"Was filled with many sounds woven into one
Oblivious melody, confusing sense
Amid the gliding waves & shadows dun;
"And as I looked the bright omnipresence
Of morning through the orient cavern flowed,
And the Sun's image radiantly intense
"Burned on the waters of the well that glowed
Like gold, and threaded all the forest maze
With winding paths of emerald firethere stood
"Amid the sun, as he amid the blaze
Of his own glory, on the vibrating
Floor of the fountain, paved with flashing rays,
"A shape all light, which with one hand did fling
Dew on the earth, as if she were the Dawn
Whose invisible rain forever seemed to sing
"A silver music on the mossy lawn,
And still before her on the dusky grass
Iris her many coloured scarf had drawn.
"In her right hand she bore a crystal glass
Mantling with bright Nepenthe;the fierce splendour
Fell from her as she moved under the mass
"Of the deep cavern, & with palms so tender
Their tread broke not the mirror of its billow,
Glided along the river, and did bend her
"Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow
Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream
That whispered with delight to be their pillow.
"As one enamoured is upborne in dream
O'er lily-paven lakes mid silver mist
To wondrous music, so this shape might seem
"Partly to tread the waves with feet which kist
The dancing foam, partly to glide along
The airs that roughened the moist amethyst,
"Or the slant morning beams that fell among
The trees, or the soft shadows of the trees;
And her feet ever to the ceaseless song
"Of leaves & winds & waves & birds & bees
And falling drops moved in a measure new
Yet sweet, as on the summer evening breeze
"Up from the lake a shape of golden dew
Between two rocks, athwart the rising moon,
Moves up the east, where eagle never flew.
"And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune
To which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot
The thoughts of him who gazed on them, & soon
"All that was seemed as if it had been not,
As if the gazer's mind was strewn beneath
Her feet like embers, & she, thought by thought,
"Trampled its fires into the dust of death,
As Day upon the threshold of the east
Treads out the lamps of night, until the breath
"Of darkness reillumines even the least
Of heaven's living eyeslike day she came,
Making the night a dream; and ere she ceased
"To move, as one between desire and shame
Suspended, I said'If, as it doth seem,
Thou comest from the realm without a name,
" 'Into this valley of perpetual dream,
Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why
Pass not away upon the passing stream.'
" 'Arise and quench thy thirst,' was her reply,
And as a shut lily, stricken by the wand
Of dewy morning's vital alchemy,
"I rose; and, bending at her sweet command,
Touched with faint lips the cup she raised,
And suddenly my brain became as sand
"Where the first wave had more than half erased
The track of deer on desert Labrador,
Whilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed
"Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore
Until the second burstsso on my sight
Burst a new Vision never seen before.
"And the fair shape waned in the coming light
As veil by veil the silent splendour drops
From Lucifer, amid the chrysolite
"Of sunrise ere it strike the mountain tops
And as the presence of that fairest planet
Although unseen is felt by one who hopes
"That his day's path may end as he began it
In that star's smile, whose light is like the scent
Of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it,
"Or the soft note in which his dear lament
The Brescian shepherd breathes, or the caress
That turned his weary slumber to content.
"So knew I in that light's severe excess
The presence of that shape which on the stream
Moved, as I moved along the wilderness,
"More dimly than a day appearing dream,
The ghost of a forgotten form of sleep
A light from Heaven whose half extinguished beam
"Through the sick day in which we wake to weep
Glimmers, forever sought, forever lost.
So did that shape its obscure tenour keep
"Beside my path, as silent as a ghost;
But the new Vision, and its cold bright car,
With savage music, stunning music, crost
"The forest, and as if from some dread war
Triumphantly returning, the loud million
Fiercely extolled the fortune of her star.
"A moving arch of victory the vermilion
And green & azure plumes of Iris had
Built high over her wind-winged pavilion,
"And underneath aetherial glory clad
The wilderness, and far before her flew
The tempest of the splendour which forbade
Shadow to fall from leaf or stone;the crew
Seemed in that light like atomies that dance
Within a sunbeam.Some upon the new
"Embroidery of flowers that did enhance
The grassy vesture of the desart, played,
Forgetful of the chariot's swift advance;
"Others stood gazing till within the shade
Of the great mountain its light left them dim.
Others outspeeded it, and others made
"Circles around it like the clouds that swim
Round the high moon in a bright sea of air,
And more did follow, with exulting hymn,
"The chariot & the captives fettered there,
But all like bubbles on an eddying flood
Fell into the same track at last & were
"Borne onward.I among the multitude
Was swept; me sweetest flowers delayed not long,
Me not the shadow nor the solitude,
"Me not the falling stream's Lethean song,
Me, not the phantom of that early form
Which moved upon its motion,but among
"The thickest billows of the living storm
I plunged, and bared my bosom to the clime
Of that cold light, whose airs too soon deform.
"Before the chariot had begun to climb
The opposing steep of that mysterious dell,
Behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme
"Of him whom from the lowest depths of Hell
Through every Paradise & through all glory
Love led serene, & who returned to tell
"In words of hate & awe the wondrous story
How all things are transfigured, except Love;
For deaf as is a sea which wrath makes hoary
"The world can hear not the sweet notes that move
The sphere whose light is melody to lovers-
A wonder worthy of his rhymethe grove
"Grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers,
The earth was grey with phantoms, & the air
Was peopled with dim forms, as when there hovers
"A flock of vampire-bats before the glare
Of the tropic sun, bring ere evening
Strange night upon some Indian isle,thus were
"Phantoms diffused around, & some did fling
Shadows of shadows, yet unlike themselves,
Behind them, some like eaglets on the wing
"Were lost in the white blaze, others like elves
Danced in a thousand unimagined shapes
Upon the sunny streams & grassy shelves;
"And others sate chattering like restless apes
On vulgar paws and voluble like fire.
Some made a cradle of the ermined capes
"Of kingly mantles, some upon the tiar
Of pontiffs sate like vultures, others played
Within the crown which girt with empire
"A baby's or an idiot's brow, & made
Their nests in it; the old anatomies
Sate hatching their bare brood under the shade
"Of demon wings, and laughed from their dead eyes
To reassume the delegated power
Arrayed in which these worms did monarchize
"Who make this earth their charnel.Others more
Humble, like falcons sate upon the fist
Of common men, and round their heads did soar,
"Or like small gnats & flies, as thick as mist
On evening marshes, thronged about the brow
Of lawyer, statesman, priest & theorist,
"And others like discoloured flakes of snow
On fairest bosoms & the sunniest hair
Fell, and were melted by the youthful glow
"Which they extinguished; for like tears, they were
A veil to those from whose faint lids they rained
In drops of sorrow.I became aware
"Of whence those forms proceeded which thus stained
The track in which we moved; after brief space
From every form the beauty slowly waned,
"From every firmest limb & fairest face
The strength & freshness fell like dust, & left
The action & the shape without the grace
"Of life; the marble brow of youth was cleft
With care, and in the eyes where once hope shone
Desire like a lioness bereft
"Of its last cub, glared ere it died; each one
Of that great crowd sent forth incessantly
These shadows, numerous as the dead leaves blown
"In Autumn evening from a popular tree
Each, like himself & like each other were,
At first, but soon distorted, seemed to be
"Obscure clouds moulded by the casual air;
And of this stuff the car's creative ray
Wrought all the busy phantoms that were there
"As the sun shapes the cloudsthus, on the way
Mask after mask fell from the countenance
And form of all, and long before the day
"Was old, the joy which waked like Heaven's glance
The sleepers in the oblivious valley, died,
And some grew weary of the ghastly dance
"And fell, as I have fallen by the way side,
Those soonest from whose forms most shadows past
And least of strength & beauty did abide."
"Then, what is Life?" I said . . . the cripple cast
His eye upon the car which now had rolled
Onward, as if that look must be the last,
And answered .... "Happy those for whom the fold

And like a dying lady, lean and pale, 
Who totters forth, wrapp'd in a gauzy veil, 
Out of her chamber, led by the insane 
And feeble wanderings of her fading brain, 
The moon arose up in the murky East, 
A white and shapeless mass.
#END#
Unfathomable Sea! whose waves are years,
      Ocean of Time, whose waters of deep woe
Are brackish with the salt of human tears!
      Thou shoreless flood, which in thy ebb and flow
Claspest the limits of mortality!

   And sick of prey, yet howling on for more,
Vomitest thy wrecks on its inhospitable shore;
      Treacherous in calm, and terrible in storm,
         Who shall put forth on thee,
            Unfathomable Sea?
#END#
Like the ghost of a dear friend dead
          Is Time long past.
A tone which is now forever fled,
A hope which is now forever past,
A love so sweet it could not last,
          Was Time long past.

   There were sweet dreams in the night
          Of Time long past:
And, was it sadness or delight,
Each day a shadow onward cast
Which made us wish it yet might last
          That Time long past.

   There is regret, almost remorse,
          For Time long past.
'Tis like a child's belovèd corse
A father watches, till at last
Beauty is like remembrance, cast
          From Time long past.
#END#
One word is too often profaned
      For me to profane it,
One feeling too falsely disdained
      For thee to disdain it;
One hope is too like despair
      For prudence to smother,
And pity from thee more dear
      Than that from another.

   I can give not what men call love,
      But wilt thou accept not
The worship the heart lifts above
      And the Heavens reject not,
The desire of the moth for the star,
      Of the night for the morrow,
The devotion to something afar
      From the sphere of our sorrow?
#END#
Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
                Bird thou never wert,
         That from Heaven, or near it,
                Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

         Higher still and higher
                From the earth thou springest
         Like a cloud of fire;
                The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.

         In the golden lightning
                Of the sunken sun,
         O'er which clouds are bright'ning,
                Thou dost float and run;
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.

         The pale purple even
                Melts around thy flight;
         Like a star of Heaven,
                In the broad day-light
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight,

         Keen as are the arrows
                Of that silver sphere,
         Whose intense lamp narrows
                In the white dawn clear
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.

         All the earth and air
                With thy voice is loud,
         As, when night is bare,
                From one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflow'd.

         What thou art we know not;
                What is most like thee?
         From rainbow clouds there flow not
                Drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.

         Like a Poet hidden
                In the light of thought,
         Singing hymns unbidden,
                Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:

         Like a high-born maiden
                In a palace-tower,
         Soothing her love-laden
                Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:

         Like a glow-worm golden
                In a dell of dew,
         Scattering unbeholden
                Its a{:e}real hue
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:

         Like a rose embower'd
                In its own green leaves,
         By warm winds deflower'd,
                Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves:

         Sound of vernal showers
                On the twinkling grass,
         Rain-awaken'd flowers,
                All that ever was
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.

         Teach us, Sprite or Bird,
                What sweet thoughts are thine:
         I have never heard
                Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.

         Chorus Hymeneal,
                Or triumphal chant,
         Match'd with thine would be all
                But an empty vaunt,
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.

         What objects are the fountains
                Of thy happy strain?
         What fields, or waves, or mountains?
                What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?

         With thy clear keen joyance
                Languor cannot be:
         Shadow of annoyance
                Never came near thee:
Thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.

         Waking or asleep,
                Thou of death must deem
         Things more true and deep
                Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?

         We look before and after,
                And pine for what is not:
         Our sincerest laughter
                With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.

         Yet if we could scorn
                Hate, and pride, and fear;
         If we were things born
                Not to shed a tear,
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.

         Better than all measures
                Of delightful sound,
         Better than all treasures
                That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!

         Teach me half the gladness
                That thy brain must know,
         Such harmonious madness
                From my lips would flow
The world should listen then, as I am listening now.

Best and brightest, come away!
Fairer far than this fair Day,
Which, like thee to those in sorrow,
Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow
To the rough Year just awake
In its cradle on the brake.
The Brightest hour of unborn Spring,
Through the winter wandering,
Found, it seems, the halcyon Morn
To hoar February born.
Bending from Heaven, in azure mirth,
It kissed the forehead of the Earth,
And smiled upon the silent sea,
And bade the frozen streams be free,
And waked to music all their fountains,
And breathed upon the frozen mountains,
And like a prophetess of May
Strewed flowers upon the barren way,
Making the wintry world appear
Like one on whom thou smilest, dear.
Away, away, from men and towns,
To the wild wood and the downs—
To the silent wilderness
Where the soul need not repress
Its music lest it should not find
An echo in another’s mind.
While the touch of Nature’s art
Harmonizes heart to heart.
I leave this notice on my door
For each accustomed visitor:—
“I am gone into the fields
To take what this sweet hour yields;—
Reflection, you may come tomorrow,
Sit by the fireside with Sorrow.—
You with the unpaid bill, Despair,—
You, tiresome verse-reciter, Care,—
I will pay you in the grave,—
Death will listen to your stave.
Expectation too, be off!
Today is for itself enough;
Hope, in pity mock not Woe
With smiles, nor follow where I go;
Long having lived on thy sweet food,
At length I find one moment’s good
After long pain—with all your love,
This you never told me of.”

Radiant Sister of the Day,
Awake! arise! And come away!
To the wild woods and the plains,
And the pools where winter rains
Image all their roof of leaves,
Where the pine its garland weaves
Of sapless green, and ivy dun
Round stems that never kiss the sun:
Where the lawns and pastures be,
And the sandhills of the sea:—
Where the melting hoar-frost wets
The daisy-star that never sets,
And wind-flowers, and violets,
Which yet join not scent to hue,
Crown the pale year weak and new;
When the night is left behind
In the deep east, dun and blind,
And the blue noon is over us,
And the multitudinous
Billows murmur at our feet,
Where the earth and ocean meet,
And all things seem only one
In the universal sun.
#END#
Swiftly walk o'er the western wave,
            Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear,
            Swift be thy flight!

   Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
            Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand
            Come, long-sought!

   When I arose and saw the dawn,
            I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest.
            I sighed for thee.

   Thy brother Death came, and cried,
            Wouldst thou me?
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee,
Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?And I replied,
            No, not thee!

   Death will come when thou art dead,
            Soon, too soon
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, belovèd Night
Swift be thine approaching flight,
            Come soon, soon!
#END#
I 
 Art thou pale for weariness
      Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
Wandering companionless
      Among the stars that have a different birth, 
            And ever changing, like a joyless eye
            That finds no object worth its constancy?

II 
Thou chosen sister of the Spirit,
      That gazes on thee till in thee it pities ...
#END#
Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know
That things depart which never may return:
Childhood and youth, friendship and love’s first glow,
Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.
These common woes I feel. One loss is mine
Which thou too feel’st, yet I alone deplore.
Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine
On some frail bark in winter’s midnight roar:
Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood
Above the blind and battling multitude:
In honoured poverty thy voice did weave
Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,—
Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,
Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.
